The ease with which monetary value can now easily flow into Myanmar opens up many new opportunities for the country and its people. Our long-term goal is to apply new technologies to facilitate large-scale market-driven societal improvement across Southeast Asia, which has many big problems that still need to be solved (excluding Singapore, which has most of the privileged 1% of Southeast Asia who don't need help). We are starting with Myanmar, as I have family connections via my parents who were citizens, and it has a high concentration of serious humanitarian problems, many of which I have witnessed first-hand there. SKYBIT's initial services are: Payment Processor: SKYBIT will take cryptocurrency payment and credit the merchant or charity organization with Myanmar Kyat currency. Therefore: 1. Any Myanmar person or business can now offer their goods and services to the entire world on the internet with the expectation of receiving money for them through SKYBIT; 2. Donations worth even a small amount can now easily come into Myanmar. These were previously impossible or difficult. Ad Pages: Users who do not have their own web site can advertise or campaign to raise funds on SKYBIT Ad Pages. This can expand our market and therefore user base to a much greater portion of the Myanmar population. Exchange: Users can swap cryptoassets and local currency on our trading platform. SKYBIT as a company aims to apply cutting-edge technologies to Myanmar in order to make a significantly positive difference to the country and the lives of its people. We embrace innovation, open-mindedness, lateral thinking and creative ideas that can solve real problems and immensely improve efficiency and productivity in both business and everyday living. We are not afraid to challenge or discard antiquated thinking and beliefs that restrain progress, much of which still persists in Myanmar. We will disrupt the status quo in order to improve the country, its economy, and the lives of all Myanmar people who for so long have been denied a better future until recently. We are building the groundwork for the upcoming paradigm shift of individual empowerment via freely-flowing global value exchange. Together, we have the potential to revolutionize entire industries and even create new ones in Myanmar. This will help to economically strengthen the country and in turn raise the standards of living of Myanmar society at all levels. The possibilities of applying innovative technologies to Myanmar in particular are profound, if given enough thought as we have. Those who choose to remain with outdated systems and practices and refuse to adapt or explore can step aside to make way for the dawning of an exciting new era of mass social development in Myanmar that is driven by rapid technological advancement and leapfrogging. Join us in our quest to propel Myanmar forward and upward. The sky is the limit.",Myanmar

We believe in the power of the crowd and people’s ability to unite to create lasting positive social and environmental impacts, while also earning healthy financial returns. This equity crowdfunding campaign is the embodiment of those principles. It’s an unprecedented opportunity for anyone who shares these values to join the fast-growing PowerErn movement and benefit from the success of one of the most exciting and disruptive companies on the planet. With the downfall of Solar Prices there’s an emerging market to facilitate funding for small-to-medium commercial and industrial distributed solar projects for schools, businesses and organisations, ranging from 50 KWp to 1 MWp in electricity-generating capacity. These projects represent a promising market that is largely untapped, primarily because traditional solar financiers and foreign investors prefer to fund larger portfolios of solar projects or centralised utility-scale solar plants. To overcome these barriers, PowerErn has created a marketplace and unified dashboard, which connects organisations interested in deploying solar power- for small-to-medium commercial and industrial distributed solar projects for schools, businesses and organisations,(solar power off-takers) with suppliers and a passionate crowd of solar advocates and supporters from around the world.",United Arab Emirates
