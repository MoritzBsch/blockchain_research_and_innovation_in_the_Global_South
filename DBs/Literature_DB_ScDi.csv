M. Sahoo; S. S. Singhar; B. Nayak; B. K. Mohanta,A Blockchain Based Framework Secured by ECDSA to Curb Drug Counterfeiting,2019,"Drug counterfeit has become a global issue. The counterfeit problem has become so huge that it has drawn a significant attention among researchers and policy makers. The fake drug industry is worth of 10 billion dollar per year as estimated by `ASSOCHAM' in 2017. Also estimated by WHO about a million die per year due to fake drugs. The dispensation of fake drugs is the pivotal concern, specially in developing countries like India. One of main reason in drug counterfeiting is imperfect supply chain. There are many loop holes in our current policy of drug supply chain management system. In the present scenario of supply chain, either the information is not shared between the parties during the hand off process at all or a little or irrelevant information is shared. Once a party transfer the drug to another party, the first party doesn't know what happens to the drugs there after. The counterfeit drug not only affect the health condition of patient or the financial loss of genuine manufacturer but also it is posing serious threat to the socio-economic status of the society. In this paper, we explain details of the drug counterfeit along with a little history of the pharmacy industry and its impact on different areas and also to counter the counterfeits using Blockchain technology. Using Blockchain technology we explained here how to add traceability, visibility, and security to the drug supply chain. This proposed system will track the drugs from its origin from the manufacturer to the end the consumer."
"Mvula F., Phiri J., Tembo S.",A blockchain based mobile money interoperability scheme,2020,"Developing Countries in Africa in general and Zambia in particular, have seen a rapid rise in use of mobile payment platforms. This has not only revolutionized access to finance for the poor but also allowed them access to other financial products such as savings or insurance. With a growing number of mobile money providers in Zambia, there is need for a solution that would enable integration of the mobile money provider's systems using a central clearinghouse for purposes of clearing and settlement to achieve mobile money interoperability. In this study, we first reviewed the technical landscape and features of mobile payment systems in Zambia and then assessed the feasibility of using blockchain technology in proposing a settlement and clearing system that would facilitate mobile money interoperability. A prototype system was then designed in which amounts being interchanged between providers are managed as assets on a permissioned blockchain. The system runs a distributed shared ledger, which provides nonrepudiation, data privacy and data origin authentication, by leveraging the consistency features of blockchain technology. © 2013 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization."
"Bechtsis D., Tsolakis N., Bizakis A., Vlachos D.",A Blockchain Framework for Containerized Food Supply Chains,2019,"Global agricultural trade flows demonstrated a three-fold growth during the past decade particularly in emerging economies. At the same time, global food scandals in conjunction with the spillover effects in economy and society highlight the unreliability of existing food tracking systems and the inefficiency in monitoring food quality and fraud incidents across global food supply chains (SCs). Blockchain technology (BCT), which has already been successfully applied on the financial industry to validate critical transactions, seems to be a promising option. This research investigates a two-stage containerized food SC by implementing a demonstrator application at the Hyperledger Fabric framework. The study findings indicates that on one hand BCT has entered its maturity phase while on the other hand its adoption in food SC operations could add significant value by authenticating critical parameters and providing enhanced traceability. At the same time, BCT enabled by other digital technologies could allow for the optimization of global food SCs. Thus, BCT constitutes a promising digital technology that provides the capability to food SC stakeholders to securely share information, enhance process control and traceability and prevent potential risks. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."
"Khalid S., Maqbool A., Rana T., Naheed A.",A Blockchain-Based Solution to Control Power Losses in Pakistan,2020,"For the growth of an economy, the satisfactory and steady availability of energy supplies is necessary. A developing country (like Pakistan) encounters perpetual issues of power losses. This paper explores the challenges faced by the power economy in Pakistan. Furthermore, technologies to prevent power losses are studied and analyzed. Based on the blockchain technology, this paper proposes a power loss preventing solution by using Ethereum smart contracts. These contracts handle both sides of the power economy (the consumer and the grid) by ensuring the integrity and security of data. For the evaluation of our proposed solution, we implement the contracts and the results show that our solution is effective in reducing the line losses. The proposed solution is location independent and can be applied to economies facing similar issues. © 2020, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals."
"Kittipanya-ngam, P; Tan, KH",A framework for food supply chain digitalization: lessons from Thailand,2020,"The promise of digitalization is enormous and nowhere is it more critical than in its potential to transform food supply chain. Consumers have become more educated and are demanding real-time updated information on foods they consumed through digital media. They are also increasingly demanding to know if the foods they consume are environmentally and socially sustainable or not. As a result, food product traceability, safety, and sustainability issues have become crucial concerns to food retailers, distributors, processors, and farmers. Digitalization allows food supply chains to be highly connected, efficient, and responsive to customer needs and regulation requirements. However, digitalizing a traditional food supply chain is challenging and resource demanding. This is more so for developing countries where moving food from farms to consumers can take months as it travels through an array of middlemen. Unfortunately, little is available in the existing literature on food supply chain digitalization. So far, current researchers mainly explore the benefits of digitalization. Using cases in three companies, this paper explores the practices, challenges, and opportunities faced by Thailand food manufacturers in digitalizing their food supply chains. A framework for food supply chain digitalization is proposed and its implications for research and practices are discussed."
I. A. Hashish; F. Forni; G. Andreotti; T. Facchinetti; S. Darjani,A Hybrid Model for Bitcoin Prices Prediction using Hidden Markov Models and Optimized LSTM Networks,2019,"With the recent advances in the Blockchain technology, and due to its decentralized nature, it has been a much considered approach for solving issues in the Internet of Things (IoT) sector, in particular, for IoT payment platforms. As Machine-to-Machine (M2M) payments are fundamental in the IoT economy, the development of Blockchain-based payment platforms, using cryptocurrency, is continuously increasing as it enables a pure M2M, secure and private financial transactions. Unlike traditional assets, cryptocurrencies have a higher index of volatility, which makes it essential to understand the movement of their prices, as a first step to optimize Blockchain-based M2M payment transactions. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid model that deals with this challenge from a descriptive, as well as predictive points of view. We use Hidden Markov Models to describe cryptocurrencies historical movements to predict future movements with Long Short Term Memory networks. To evaluate the proposed hybrid model, we have chosen 2-minute frequency Bitcoin data from Coinbase exchange market. Our proposed model proved its effectiveness compared to traditional time-series forecasting models, ARIMA, as well as a conventional LSTM."
"Özyılmaz K.R., Kongel N.B., Nalbant A.E., Özcan A.",A Multi-protocol Payment System to Facilitate Financial Inclusion,2019,"In 2017, there were already 250 million unbanked people with a smartphone and internet access out of a total 1,7 billion, while only in 2018, the volume of migrant remittance inflows for low-and middle-income countries was $529 billion. Due to financial crisis leading to devaluation and hyperinflation, 12 countries (other than the USA) with 40,5 million population already adopted the U.S. dollar as their native currency. Alternatively, Bitcoin usage soared among people in developing countries who are looking for dependable ways to store and transfer value. Bitcoin, with its estimated 25 million global users and ten thousand globally distributed nodes, is by far the most widely used, best understood and battle-tested cryptocurrency in the world to reach this financially excluded demographic. Our goal in this paper is to demonstrate a technical solution that utilizes Bitcoin by making it (a) instantly transferable in a user-friendly way, (b) with minimal (preferably zero) transaction fees and (c) without sacrificing users’ security (i.e. by not controlling their private keys). In our design, instant transactions are enabled by using 2-of-2 multisignature wallet addresses (split between the user and the custodial) and transaction fees are minimized by aggregating unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). On top of these two pure Bitcoin-based improvements, a fast and low-cost Bitcoin sending mechanism is proposed by creating a “Bitcoin anchor” on Stellar platform, effectively using Stellar as a “Layer 2” solution. Lastly, mapping Bitcoin addresses to user-friendly identifiers (such as email addresses) has been evaluated to increase adoption. By combining these new techniques, we aim to overcome the limitations of Bitcoin and related solutions like off-chain (Lightning Networks) or federated side-chain (Blockstream Liquid) systems. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019."
"Jamil, F; Hang, L; Kim, K; Kim, D",A Novel Medical Blockchain Model for Drug Supply Chain Integrity Management in a Smart Hospital,2019,"At present, in pharmacology one of the most serious problems is counterfeit drugs. The Health Research Funding organization reported that in developing countries, nearly 10-30% of the drugs are fake. Counterfeiting is not the main issue itself, but, rather, the fact that, as compared to traditional drugs, these counterfeit drugs produce different side effects to human health. According to WHO, around 30% of the total medicine sold in Africa, Asia, and Latin America is counterfeit. This is the major worldwide problem, and the situation is worse in developing countries, where one out of every 10 medicines are either fake or do not follow drug regulations. The rise of Internet pharmacies has made it more difficult to standardize drug safety. It is difficult to detect counterfeits because these drugs pass through different complex distributed networks, thus forming opportunities for counterfeits to enter the authentic supply chain. The safety of the pharmaceutical supply chain has become a major concern for public health, which is a collective process. In this paper, we propose a novel drug supply chain management using Hyperledger Fabric based on blockchain technology to handle secure drug supply chain records. The proposed system solves this problem by conducting drug record transactions on a blockchain to create a smart healthcare ecosystem with a drug supply chain. A smart contract is launched to give time-limited access to electronic drug records and also patient electronic health records. We also carried out a number of experiments in order to demonstrate the usability and efficiency of the designed platform. Finally, we used Hyperledger Caliper as a benchmarking tool to conduct the performance of the designed system in terms of transactions per second, transaction latency, and resource utilization."

Asad,A Novel Remote User Authentication Scheme by using Private Blockchain-Based Secure Access Control for Agriculture Monitoring,2020,"Pakistan is an agricultural country and its economy is mainly dependent on agriculture. Agriculture provides large economic opportunities along with the yield of food and other raw materials in our life. To increase the yield of products there is a need for the deployment of modern technology. To tackle this problem, a private blockchain-based secure access control for agriculture can be employed to monitor the different climatic parameters such as (light, humidity, temperature, and, soil moisture, etc) in the fields. The environmental and climatic parameters are very important for the quantity, quality, efficient growth of the crops. Also, any kind of unwanted modification, interception, and expunction on these parameters can leave a bad impact on fields and crops. Therefore, privacy and security are key challenges while deploying the monitoring systems in the fields. In this regard, we have designed a novel remote user authentication scheme by using private blockchain-based secure access control for agriculture monitoring. The proposed scheme is authorized through private blockchain access control (PBAC) algorithms and is applied using hyper ledger cello tools. We customarily analyze the privacy and security of the scheme by using a random oracle model. Furthermore, the proposed protocol is secure and resist different sorts of malicious attacks. The proposed scheme is also suitable in a real-life application to avoid all kinds of security attacks."
"Uddin M.A., Stranier A., Gondal I., Balasubramanian V.",A patient agent to manage blockchains for remote patient monitoring,2018,"Continuous monitoring of patient's physiological signs has the potential to augment traditional medical practice, particularly in developing countries that have a shortage of healthcare professionals. However, continuously streamed data presents additional security, storage and retrieval challenges and further inhibits initiatives to integrate data to form electronic health record systems. Blockchain technologies enable data to be stored securely and inexpensively without recourse to a trusted authority. Blockchain technologies also promise to provide architectures for electronic health records that do not require huge government expenditure that challenge developing nations. However, Blockchain deployment, particularly with streamed data challenges existing Blockchain algorithms that take too long to place data in a block, and have no mechanism to determine whether every data point in every stream should be stored in such a secure way. This article presents an architecture that involves a Patient Agent, coordinating the insertion of continuous data streams into Blockchains to form an electronic health record. © 2018 The authors and IOS Press.

I. Chuang; T. Weng; J. Tsai; M. Horng; Y. Kuo,A Reliable IoT Data Economic System Based on Edge Computing,2018,"IoT data economy is an emerging concept since sensing data are widely applied in various IoT services. To maintain the stability of data economic system, this paper proposes the Reliable IoT Data Economic System (RIDES) to provide IoT data a reliable, automatic, and intelligent trading environment. Applying the smart contract technique, IoT data in RIDES can be automatically traded without human intervention. As the trading procedure is performed based on blockchain, all transactions can be protected against tampering. Also, the RIDES provides the Smart Decision Making Module for users to develop practical pricing strategies. Thus, a seller can derive a price with the highest expected revenue for its data and a buyer can purchase its desired data referring to cost-performance ratio or data owner's trustworthiness. Even if malicious sellers cheat buyers, the latter can invoke trade dispute procedure to refund their payment, which makes the trading environment more reliable. As the blockchain-based operations usually cost much, the RIDES adopts the edge computing architecture to alleviate the burdens of IoT devices. Finally, the RIDES is implemented in IoT environments. The case study demonstrates that the transactions on IoT data can be performed correctly by RIDES."
"Chawdhuri, DR; Kramer, J; Judge, S",Acceptable Privacy for XAND Blockchain,2019,"Recently, the privacy of blockchain transactions has taken center stage. Privacy is an essential feature of crypto-transactions. We have seen privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies like Monero with Cryptonote protocol and Zerocash with Zk-SNARKs. However, the privacy of transactions comes at the cost of the transactions not being visible at all to any regulatory bodies. In most developed or developing countries, the Government is democratic, and it is generally a good idea for the Government to be able to prevent illicit activities like foreign exchange frauds, black markets, criminal funding, and drug trafficking. The XAND blockchain aims to resolve this problem by allowing some authorized participants to view the transactions, while at the same time maintaining the privacy of the transactions from other regular users, including the validators."
"Devi, GSP; Pamila, JCMJ",ACCIDENT ALERT SYSTEM APPLICATION USING A PRIVACY-PRESERVING BLOCKCHAIN-BASED INCENTIVE MECHANISM,2019,"In this era of rapid growth of vehicles, the ratio of road accident increases day by day. Nowadays, Traffic incidents are persistent problems in both developed and developing countries which result in huge loss of life and property. No one in this world is ready to gaze what's happening around them. Nobody cares even when an accident occurs. This paper provides an innovative solution by developing an Accident Alert Message System using an Android Smartphone Application that can be used from the accident zone. The application uses GPS technology for location mapping and sends an alert and notification of an accident. The generated accident alert message is endorsed by the nearby registered users who also witness the accident to ensure the increased reputation of the message. Based on the endorsement of the message, the system will instantly transmit the location of the accident to the nearby emergency services. In this case, users usually lack the enthusiasm to generate or endorse alert messages because they might fear that their privacy will be breached. At the same time, users do not benefit from generating or endorsing alert messages which also makes them lack the enthusiasm or motivation to respond to messages. In order to provide a solution to resolve these issues, this paper presents a novel privacy-preserving Blockchain Based Incentive Mechanism for Accident Alert Message System. The main objective of the paper is to encourage the users to generate and endorse accident alert messages from the accident zone without revealing the user's identity. Also, some incentives to the users are paid to the message generators and endorsers and the transactions get stored based on the Blockchain technology; hence the privacy of the user is preserved. Our proposed system ensures the reliability of alert messages without revealing the privacy of the user and is reliable and efficient in the non-fully-trusted environment."
"Paul S., Joy J.I., Sarker S., Shakib A.-A.-H., Ahmed S., Das A.K.",An unorthodox way of farming without intermediaries through blockchain,2019,"Blockchain technology has the scope of creating a decentralized environment where any third-party organization does not manipulate transactions, and the transaction is recorded in a public ledger permanently within the first-ever occurrence. The backbone of the developing countries' economy depends on farming. When farmers sell their crops, they don't get their desired money following their hard work due to the existence of a loop that always creates an artificial crisis, which causes rise to the price of the farming goods. As a result, the farmer doesn't get this extra money as a middle-man between the farmers and the consumers are taking this extra money out. Though modern farming involves science and technology, still it is centralized and not transparent to all. Based on blockchain technology, the study proposed a decentralized agricultural platform, named KHET to resolve the mentioned issue. This paper constitutes trust and decentralization between agricultural stakeholders such as farmers, supply companies, and markets. © 2019 IEEE."

"Parino F., Beiró M.G., Gauvin L.",Analysis of the Bitcoin blockchain: socio-economic factors behind the adoption,2018,"As the first decentralized digital currency introduced in 2009 together with the blockchain, Bitcoin offers new opportunities both for developed and developing countries. Bitcoin peer-to-peer transactions are independent of the banking system, facilitating foreign exchanges with low transaction fees, such as remittances, and offering a high degree of anonymity. These opportunities together with other key factors led the Bitcoin to become extremely popular and caused its price to skyrocket during 2017 (Henry et al. in J Digit Bank 2(4):311–337, 2018). However, while the Bitcoin blockchain attracts a lot of attention, it remains difficult to investigate where this attention comes from, due to the pseudo-anonymity of the system, and consequently to appreciate its social impact. Here we make an attempt to characterize the adoption of the Bitcoin blockchain by country. In the first part of the work we show that information about the number of Bitcoin software client downloads, the IP addresses that act as relays for the transactions, and the Internet searches about Bitcoin provide together a coherent picture of the system evolution in different countries. Using these quantities as a proxy for user adoption, we identify several socio-economic indexes such as the GDP per capita, freedom of trade and the Internet penetration as key variables correlated with the degree of user adoption. In the second part of the work, we build a network of Bitcoin transactions between countries using the IP addresses of nodes relaying transactions and we develop an augmented version of the gravity model of trade in order to identify socio-economic factors linked to the flow of Bitcoin between countries. In a nutshell our study provides a new insight on Bitcoin adoption by country and on the potential socio-economic drivers of the international Bitcoin flow. © 2018, The Author(s)."

R. Raj; N. Rai; S. Agarwal,Anticounterfeiting in Pharmaceutical Supply Chain by establishing Proof of Ownership,2019,"Drug counterfeiting is a serious and increasing critical issue worldwide, which puts the health of consumers and the general population at risk. WHO estimates that the world's counterfeit drug market make billions of dollars annually. It is due to the inadequate supply chain in the developing countries that one in the drug is counterfeit. People buying such medicines not only waste their money but also put their life and health in danger. A drug's ownership changes from manufacturer to distributor and then to the pharmacist before reaching the customer. The manufacturers don't know how their drug is being used. At the same time, consumers don't know whether the drug has come from the rightful source. It is due to the counterfeit drug in the supply chain manufacturing companies and countries face huge economic loss. The RFID technology has been effective for over a decade providing anti-counterfeit measures to the supply chain. However, the RFID tags cannot be guaranteed genuineness, since the tags can be cloned easily. In this paper, we propose how blockchain can be utilized to not only prevent drug counterfeiting but also add traceability, security, and visibility to the pharmaceutical supply chain. For this purpose, a permissioned blockchain is designed to which only trusted parties can join the network and push transactions to the blockchain."
"Zhang, D",Application of Blockchain Technology in Incentivizing Efficient Use of Rural Wastes: A case study on Yitong System,2019,"Rural areas in developing countries have constantly been plagued by poor sanitation and energy shortages. A key issue has been the decentralized nature of waste generation and energy consumption, leading to farmers burning crop stocks, lumber, and other agricultural waste. As 1.9 billion people lack access to waste collection services [1], untreated solid and liquid refuse hamper the health of many and irreversibly damage the local ecosystem. Considering the scattered nature of agricultural waste generation and centralized treatment difficulties, this study examines the feasibility of adopting decentralized blockchain system in trading biomass energy and agricultural products across the waste-to-energy ecosystem. A case study is conducted based on the Yitong system in Changzhi City, Shanxi Province, China. This plant collects and transports agricultural wastes (crop straw and animal residue), and converts them to clean energy and agricultural by-products like briquettes, fertilizer, and animal feedstock. This paper presents how a digital coupon or cryptocurrency can be introduced to trade the wastes, energy and byproducts among the farmers and entrepreneurs. It argues that this system could maximize the use of agriculture wastes by incentivizing farmers and enterprises to work together. This paper covers three key areas: 1) Literature review, methodology preparation, and field assessment for introducing digital incentive mechanism to enhance rural wastes management. 2) Design of a prototype of blockchain-based model: (a) how the waste-to-energy plant managers collect the segregated waste from individual farmers through trucks connected to blockchain-based smart meters; (b) how systems on each of the trucks register the quantity of waste received onto a universal ledger when collecting. This quantity received will be translated into a certain amount of energy and products like fertilizer that the waste-to-energy plant owes each farm; and (c) how the farmers will receive digital coupons corresponding to the quantity of energy and agricultural products that they should receive. 3) Evaluation of the feasibility of blockchain-based model (technical and economic): (a) data collection on the total quantity of waste produced and the processing capabilities and availability of Waste to Energy plants; (b) assessing readiness of digital infrastructure (cyber-security and communications); and (c) economic evaluation of the incentives and responsibilities associated with the key stakeholders from the farmers to enterprises.

"Lacerda A.B., Lopes F.D.",Applications of blockchain technology in the Brazilian government,2019,"Blockchain technology has emerged as a disruptive trend that can influence business, government and society in the next years. By validating the exact time an action is taken (births, deaths, property transfers) without the need for an intermediary (a person or institution that validates the information), the technology has the potential to provide profound modifications in the public service, setting itself up as a matrix for countless possibilities in digital governance. For many theorists, it solves old questions of trust, allowing the reliability on the outputs of a system without any intermediary or mediating entity. Academic research in blockchain is still sparse though. Emerging markets have been singled out as fertile ground for the implementation of blockchain-based solutions, as technology can provide the solution to various political and social issues. The world community expects from these markets several experiments that have the potential to guide the way the blockchain is used. Given that, this paper proposes an exploratory study built from the perspective of institutional logics whose research question is: how are the institutional logics present in the Brazilian public sector responding to the incorporation of blockchain technology? In order to analyze how this recent technology with a high potential for transforming logic and routines is being absorbed by the Brazilian public sector, a qualitative approach was used to understand initial perceptions and to learn about the motivations and mechanisms of government initiatives that employ blockchain technology. For this purpose, a documentary analysis was performed and public servants from different institutions of the federal executive branch were interviewed. Our research has shown that the blockchain technology has entered the Brazilian public service scenario through an already institutionalized structure. This structure consists of a hybrid logic of different approaches to public administration, with strong bureaucratic aspects and a clear intention to become more managerial and democratic, without normally abandoning aspects of the former. We also observed from data analysis that the current projects are related to four main approaches: financial market, identification, data exchange and transparency. Despite the disruptive character of the blockchain technology, however, it may not be sufficient as a guarantee of its institutionalization in government. The technology, in our view, has not yet reached a level of implementation that allows us to define whether it will generate a new logic, imparting its disruptive character in public administration, or incorporate itself into the dominant logic. At the moment, we believe that by giving space to all the potential of the blockchain, we may see the creation of a hybrid logic, however, this will require a greater popularization of the technology in the public service and regulation that allows its development. © IAMOT 2019."
"Ku-Mahamud K.R., Omar M., Abu Bakar N.A., Muraina I.D.","Awareness, trust, and adoption of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency among blockchain communities in Malaysia",2019,"Blockchain technology and cryptocurrency are attracting increasing attention from consumers, investors, investment industry and regulators. Cryptocurrency has great potential to be used for transaction or investment in the future. However, level of awareness of the blockchain technology and cryptocurrency is still at infant stage, specifically in developing countries. Thus, this study aims to investigate the level of awareness, trust and adoption of blockchain technology among blockchain community in Malaysia. Quantitative approach was adopted in this study where a new questionnaire was developed in the first phase to measure the level of awareness, adoption, and trust of blockchain technology applications among Malaysian blockchain communities. The resulting questionnaire consists of items on respondents' demographic, their awareness, trust, and adoption of FinTech particularly on blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. In the second phase, a pilot study was conducted to validated the new questionnaire from 304 respondents. Reliability test using Cronbach's alpha with a value of 0.908. A real survey was also conducted in this phase using the validated queationnaire and data were obtained online from 304 respondents.

L. Xu; L. Chen; Z. Gao; Y. Chang; E. Iakovou; W. Shi,Binding the Physical and Cyber Worlds: A Blockchain Approach for Cargo Supply Chain Security Enhancement,2018,"Maritime transportation plays a critical role for the U.S. and global economies, and has evolved into a complex system that involves a plethora of supply chain stakeholders spread around the globe. The inherent complexity brings huge security challenges including cargo loss and high burdens in cargo inspection against illicit activities and potential terrorist attacks. The emerging blockchain technology provides a promising tool to build a unified maritime cargo tracking system critical for cargo security. However, most existing efforts focus on transportation data itself, while ignoring how to bind the physical cargo movements and information managed by the system consistently. This can severely undermine the effectiveness of securing cargo transportation. To fulfill this gap, we propose a binding scheme leveraging a novel digital identity management mechanism. The digital identity management mechanism maps the best practice in the physical world to the cyber world and can be seamlessly integrated with a blockchain-based cargo management system."

Global economic trade is often argued to be as old as trade. The question of the nature of the exchange, of who creates the value and how it is regulated is the issue. While tin from England may have reached Sumeria 4 000 years ago, or Phoenicians' ships entered the Africa area of Cape Palmas at about the same time, the problem of exchange is a central issue. Ideas of money are as diverse as the cultures that produce them, yet today global trade is experiencing modifications of the satisfaction of exchange with new platforms of electronic money. Blockchain technology is touted as foolproof, such claims have appeared in the past with various financial innovations. Such abstractions of value may not be new, but as a product of technology and complexity they create psychological novelty and a form of mesmerizing fetishism (Douglas, M. and Isherwood, B., ed.: The World of Goods: Towards an Anthropology of Consumption. Routledge, London, 1978). Manias of value are also not new, from stock (South Seas Corporation) to tulips (MacKay, C.: Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds. Crown Press, London, 1841). The form of the mania is defined and expressed culturally but is often associated with technological change and distance of exchange of partners and clients (Baric, L.: Some aspects of credit, saving and investment in a 'non-monetary' economy (Rossel Island). In: Firth, R. and Yamey, B. S., eds.: Capital, Saving and Credit in Peasant Societies. Aldine Publishing, Chicago, pp. 35-52, 1964.). Inequality is also a feature, embedded in economic and technological disruption of trade and exchange. The role of redistribution and taxation are essential in maintaining social credit and equality. We can relate such behaviour to other systems of animal societies."

Optimizing system performance is becoming a great challenge for an ever-increasing large-scale distributed application system in the digital economy on the Internet of Things (IoT) era. In a centralized BPM, many indicators, such as security and openness, or cost and flexibility, are conflicting with each other. For example, inviting new partners across enterprises, domains, and regions to form a service workflow exposes new risks and needs additional security mechanisms for scrutiny; enhancing the flexibility of business workflow compositions increases the cost of security assurance. Blockchain technology (BCT) has thrown the light on the development of vital solutions to various BPM problems. BCT has to be integrated with other BPM system components that often involve IoT devices to implement specified functionalities related to the application. Currently, the potentials of using BCT have been explored although still at an early stage. In this paper, the states of the art are presented to identify emerging research topics, challenges, and promising applications in integrating BCT into the development of BPM."

The study builds on literature research and expert interviews, and provides insights into the future energy landscape in the context of the blockchain advent. While the interviewees acknowledge the great, though disruptive, potential of blockchain technology for the primary activities in the electricity sector, there is agreement that inflexible regulatory frameworks impose the biggest challenge. The widest impact which blockchain technology will have in the short-term will be in electric vehicle integration, while in the long-term blockchain will enable peer-to-peer microgrids. The role that the blockchain will play, though, relies mainly on the business model innovation in energy. While a growing body of literature discusses specific blockchain applications and solutions in an advanced technological set-up, this paper presents a holistic picture of the blockchain applicability in the energy sector and thematises this very powerful and versatile technology against the background of two emerging economies: South Africa and Russia. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"
"Ouattara H.F., Ahmat D., Ouédraogo F.T., Bissyandé T.F., Sié O.",Blockchain consensus protocols: Towards a review of practical constraints for implementation in developing countries,2018,"There is currently a big rush in the research and practice communities to investigate the blockchain technology towards leveraging its security, immutability and transparency features to create new services or improve existing ones. In developing countries, which are seen as a fertile ground for field testing disruptive technologies, blockchain is viewed as the “trust machine” that is necessary for accelerating development. Unfortunately, the internal working of blockchain as well as its constraints are often overlooked in the design of services. This, in conjunction with a poor regulatory framework, slows down any concrete attempt to build upon the technology. In this paper, we contribute towards accelerating the concrete adoption of blockchain by making explicit the constraints that affect their practical use in the context of developing countries such as African sub-saharan countries. Overall we recommend that the technology should be adjusted to the real-world constraints, in particular those that we currently witness on network latency, computation power as well as cultural gaps. © 2018, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering."

Various proposed use instances of blockchain in tax collection can possibly trigger an upheaval in the manner in which governments gather and spend their monies. As much as individuals may abhor paying them, charges are important to empower the customary working of countries and economies. Despite the fact that administrations don't work revenue driven like organizations, they do expect to subsidize to take care of expenses for the administrations they give to general society. Be that as it may, most governments neglect to recoup a noteworthy part of the assessments owed to them and work under money related obligation and shortfall, which, in the long haul may prompt financial stagnation and a decrease in the nature of open administrations. In this way, recuperating charges is the best money related need for governments. To recoup these expenses, some of the time, government organizations end up going to broad lengths, prompting extra costs, making the whole procedure loaded with wasteful aspects. Utilizing blockchain in tax collection can make the procedure progressively productive and powerful, and guarantee that administration offices get paid what they're expected."

Smart contracts can find a wide spectrum of potential application scenarios in the digital economy and intelligent industries, including financial services, management, healthcare, and Internet of Things, among others, and also have been integrated into the mainstream blockchain-based development platforms, such as Ethereum and Hyperledger. However, smart contracts are still far from mature, and major technical challenges such as security and privacy issues are still awaiting further research efforts. For instance, the most notorious case might be â€œThe DAO Attackâ€ in June 2016, which led to more than $50 million Ether transferred into an adversary's account. In this paper, we strive to present a systematic and comprehensive overview of blockchain-enabled smart contracts, aiming at stimulating further research toward this emerging research area. We first introduced the operating mechanism and mainstream platforms of blockchain-enabled smart contracts, and proposed a research framework for smart contracts based on a novel six-layer architecture.

"Fandl, KJ",Can Smart Contracts Enhance Firm Efficiency in Emerging Markets?,2020,"Blockchain technology has the potential to eliminate one of the most significant barriers to economic growth through private business transactions in developing countries-lack of trust. In a typical developed country, individuals and firms conduct transactions within an institutional environment that offers security through the enforcement of agreements. Transparent and effective courts, while imperfect to be sure, enable parties to feel secure in their transactions even if their level of trust in the other party is low. This security, in turn, facilitates transactions far afield from high-trust relationships (e.g., immediate relatives), generating transactions based upon economic value rather than party trust alone. Developing countries often lack effective or transparent institutions and are frequently plagued with corruption that weakens substantially their level of security in economic transactions. Accordingly, individuals and firms in developing countries seek contracting parties whom they trust, knowing that it is trust that will ensure enforcement more than courts or law enforcement. Transactions in this type of environment are thus limited to known entities, such as relatives or colleagues who have a trust-relationship with the individual. As a result, potentially valuable transactions are avoided due to lack of trust, which, on a macro-level, limits the economic growth potential of the entire economy. Blockchain technology and smart contracts offer a solution to the trust problem prevalent in developing country contractual transactions. First, because blockchain uses an open architecture, all transactions are publicly accessible, immutable, and verifiable by anyone. This helps to eliminate corruption and fraud from the transaction. Second, because all smart contract transactions are recorded along a blockchain and cannot be modified ex post, a permanent and publicly accessible ledger is available to shed any doubt about payments or other transactions throughout the process. And third, because blockchain systems are automated, security in the enforcement mechanism is all but guaranteed. For instance, failure to deliver goods by a set time will automatically trigger a default clause that transmits payment of liquidated damages to the injured party without the intervention of a judge or arbitrator. Numerous problems with this approach exist. For instance, access to information about technology such as blockchain, especially among firms that would most directly benefit from it (e.g., informal firms), is highly limited for the moment. Second, smart contracts are in their infancy and work primarily with clearly stipulated terms that allow for no interpretation, which are not always common in contracts between firms. In this case, eliminating a neutral arbiter from the transaction also eliminates the possibility of reviewing the circumstances of a breach or other contract mishap. And third, though lack of trust in parties may be reduced through this technology, lack of trust in online financial transactions may be exacerbated. The use of electronic finance options in developing countries is far less common than in developed countries, making implementation of a completely online transmission system particularly challenging. Despite the evident weaknesses in applying smart contracts and blockchain technology to developing country firm transactions, there is great potential for at least small-scale application in certain markets where party trust levels are particularly low. In this paper, I will review literature on the development of smart contract technology and its application in relevant contexts. I will consider the potential impact that this technology could have if properly implemented in emerging markets. And I will offer a set of suggestions for policymakers to consider in educating firms and incentivizing their use of this technology. What follows is an introduction to the area of smart contracts as a substitute or at least a complement to legal institutions. I fully expect a robust literature to develop around this topic in the near future."

Traditionally, attackers have developed automatic programs known as CAPTCHA solvers to bypass the mechanism. With the presence of cheap labor in developing countries, hackers now have options to use human solvers. In this research, we develop a game theoretical framework to model the interactions between the defender and the attacker regarding the design and countermeasure of CAPTCHA system. With the result of equilibrium analysis, both parties can determine the optimal allocation of software-based or human-based CAPTCHA solvers. Counterintuitively, instead of the traditional wisdom of making CAPTCHA harder and harder, it may be of best interest of the defender to make CAPTCHA easier. We further suggest a welfare-improving CAPTCHA business model by involving decentralized cryptocurrency computation."

Mukherjea,Cyber Resiliency Automation Using Blockchain,2019,"Protecting organization assets from malicious attack is key to an organization business continuity goal. Most of the organizations are aware of security threats and have invested time and effort in defining a security strategy. The security strategy identifies the technology, policies, people and the processes required to deal with security breaches. However cyber incidents continue to rise and often attackers find new ways to cause damage. Since its difficult to prevent cyberattacks the focus should be more on how to respond and recover quickly from attacks. The cyber resilient approach must be based on the latest threats and needs continuous improvement. Often organizations feel that they have a cyber resilience process that works but during an attack they struggle to recover. This is mainly due to the fact that the process has many pitfalls and is not up to date. This paper briefly discusses some of the drawbacks in the processes and suggests a process utilizing blockchain which provides better security and ability to recover."

V. U. Wickramarachchi; C. I. Keppitiyagama; K. G. Gunawardana,Efficiently Transform Contracts Written in Peyton Jones Contract Descriptive Language to Solidity,2019,"Financial contracts play a major role in the modern economy. Due to a large variation of contracts being traded in financial markets, a standard representation for contracts was required in order to eliminate the ambiguity imposed by natural languages. Peyton Jones et al. catered this need by proposing a combinator library embedded in Haskell which enabled contract representation and valuation. However, every financial contract represented as such suffered from the same fundamental problem. If a contract is executable, the parties involved in the contract needed to trust a central counterparty to give them the correct results after execution. The interference of this middleman introduced certain risks as well as a significant amount of overhead. In this paper, a novel approach to facilitate autonomous contract execution was proposed, exploiting the features and use cases of the Ethereum blockchain and its scripting language, Solidity. The approach involves transforming contracts written in Peyton Jones Contract Descriptive language (CDL) to Solidity using a special purpose compiler. The result of this transformation is a smart contract equivalent to the traditional financial contract. The transformed smart contract is deployed and executed on the Ethereum blockchain using an Ethereum client. The proposed solution was evaluated against existing attempts to design autonomous financial contracts. The research shows that a contract written using CDL can be transformed into a smart contract which executes autonomously in a trust-less environment. As a result, it was concluded that financial contracts could operate without a central counterparty with increased performance and reduced overheads in comparison to traditional financial contracts."

The exchange of these records plays a critical role in care continuity. Recently, there has been increasing attention on health data privacy and confidentiality which translates to questions on ownership and accessibility of clinical records. Traditional approaches to remedy this stand the risk of reducing the accessibility of these records, making care continuity across facilities more difficult. This poses a need for mechanisms that would enable the secure exchange of health data without adversely affecting the access to clinical records.

We conducted a preliminary test to benchmark the performance of DHW in resource-constrained healthcare facilities in developing countries."
Aoun A.G.,Energy Blockchain - An incentive for der development in developing countries,2018,"Since Blockchain has gained its reputation as a secure peer-to-peer trading platform, it has been the interest of new businesses and industries worldwide. In a future where every consumer is encouraged to become a producer, where everyone is encouraged to become entrepreneurs, energy Blockchain is considered to play an important role in smart grid framework. Blockchain is deemed to change all aspects of people's digital life and the way we do transactions. By eliminating the role of third parties, Blockchain can make our systems more efficient, thus reducing cost and improving reliability. Nowadays, and as a result of the development of the renewable energy sector, the energy market is shifting towards a smart de-centralization. Nevertheless, in developing countries, the development of distributed energy generation faces several economic and financial barriers. Therefore, in countries with low Distributed Energy Resources (DER), the integration of Blockchain and peer-to-peer energy trading can create an incentive for end-users to invest in DERs and the development of microgrids. When Blockchain is integrated in the power network, it can enable the tracking of energy generated by DERs, reporting of savings from ECMs, or trading CO2 credits. So the main question is: ""How can the Blockchain be remodeled to serve the energy market and create opportunities for energy producers and consumers?"" This paper will answer this question by providing a quick overview of the Blockchain mode of operation, highlighting the potential of the Blockchain along its integration mechanism in the energy trading business, and identifying the challenges and barriers confronting the development of the energy Blockchain. © Copyright 2018 by K and L Gates LLP.

"Bhattacharyya S.S., Nair S.",Explicating the future of work: perspectives from India,2019,"Purpose: The world is witnessing the advent of a wide range of technologies like machine learning, big data analytics, artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, robotics, additive manufacturing, augmented and virtual reality, cloud computing, Internet of Things and such others. Amidst this concoction of diverse technologies, the future of work is getting redefined. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to understand the future of work in the context of an emerging economy like India. Design/methodology/approach: The authors undertook a qualitative research with a positivist approach. The authors undertook expert interviews with 26 respondents. The respondents were interviewed with a semi-structured open-ended questionnaire. The responses were content analyzed for themes. System dynamics was applied to explicate the phenomenon studied. Findings: The authors found that the future of work has multiple facets. The authors found that in future, organizations would not only use automation for lower end routine manual jobs, but also for moderate knowledge-centric tasks. Future jobs would have significant data dependency, and employees would be expected to analyze and synthesize data for sense making. Another finding pointed out that in future, individuals would be constantly required for skills upgradation and thus learning would become a continuous lifelong process. In future, individuals would get short-term tasks rather than long-term secured jobs. Thus, job flexibility would be high as freelancing would be a dominant way of work. Organizations would reduce dedicated workspaces and would use co-working spaces to reduce office space investments. In future, jobs that are impregnated with novelty and creativity would remain. A finding of concern was that with the advent of automated technologies a larger portion of workforce would lose jobs and there could be widespread unemployment that might lead to social unrest. The provision of universal basic income has been advocated by some experts to handle social crisis. Research limitations/implications: This research is based on an organization centric view that is anchored in the resource-based view and dynamic capabilities. The research contributes to the conversation of human resource co-existence with automated technologies for organizations of tomorrow. Thus, this work specifically contributes to strategic human resource with technology capabilities in organizations. Practical implications: These research findings would help organizational design and development practitioners to comprehend what kind of interventions would be required to be future ready to both accommodate technology and human resources. For policy makers, the results of this study would help them design policy interventions that could keep the nation’s workforce job ready in the age of automated technologies through investments in automated technology education. Originality/value: India is bestowed with one of the largest English-speaking, technically qualified young workforce working at lower salary levels than their developed county counterparts. The advent of automated technologies ushers in challenges and opportunities for this young qualified workforce to step into future. This is the first study from India that deliberates on the “future of work” in India. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Thess A., Klein M., Nienhaus K., Pregger T.",Global carbon surcharge for the reduction of anthropogenic emission of carbon dioxide,2020,"Background: Many governments take the view that voluntary national targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are sufficient to avoid negative climate effects. In the absence of independent verification, however, pledges are unlikely to be sufficient for a rapid and strong reduction of emissions. It is often claimed that a global carbon tax could be an effective instrument. However, such a tax is difficult to set and to collect, especially in countries with poor administrative infrastructure. Results: Here, we formulate and discuss a novel approach, the Global Carbon Surcharge (GCS), that mimics a carbon tax but does not require tax collection by governments. We define GCS as a requirement or a voluntary commitment encompassing all companies extracting carbon-carrying raw materials, namely coal, oil, gas and limestone, with the aim to burden their extraction with costs proportional to their carbon intensity. GCS mandates all companies to store these materials immediately after mining for a given period of time in the vicinity of the production site. Thereby, GCS generates additional costs that propagate through all sectors of the global economy. We elucidate how the investment costs for the storage infrastructure translate into surcharges on the raw materials. Conclusions: We show that by a proper choice of the storage time and the size of the storage unit, GCS becomes equivalent to a carbon tax in the range between 50 and 100 € per ton of CO2 that is assumed to be necessary for the transition to a carbon-neutral energy system. An attractive feature of GCS is that it can be verified, in particular by citizens themselves, using publicly available satellite data. Finally, if compulsory storage is coupled to blockchain-based smart contracts and a mandatory (expensive) mining of cryptocurrency, GCS can be operated without governmental protectionism, corruption and fraud. However, the main uncertainties of the GCS approach lie in the substantial expansion of infrastructure and the fact that the induced price effects must be sufficient to achieve a rapid and far-reaching substitution of fossil fuels. © 2020 The Author(s)."

Not only developing countries but also developed countries need to be concerned about applying blockchain technology to their e-government system. Blockchain technology has brought a very deep innovation over conventional Client Server Trusted Third Party intermediary system to pure peer-to-peer (P2P) based smart contract system. This smart contract based peer-to-peer system allow participants to share data which was not possible under Client Server Trusted Third Party system due to architectural monopoly nature of Client Server. Smart contract concept brought logical conditions to share data among participants but it does not provide any definition about data value. This peer-to-peer based data sharing can be practically possible only under definition of value on data shared. If this definition is vague, then it will be very difficult to share data among participants. Also if this definition is clear, data sharing participants can get much benefit from this data sharing. This data sharing will be only effective from blockchain based architecture. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s)."

Digitization is one of the most significant ongoing transformation processes in global agriculture. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) range from traditional communication aids (e.g. telephones, televisions), internet and mobile applications, to Big Data analytics and information systems, Cloud computing, Internet of Things, remote sensing and drones, blockchain and artificial intelligence. Different terms have been used to refer to the application of ICTs in agriculture e.g. digital agriculture, e-agriculture, smart agriculture, precision agriculture. This review paper analyses the potential of ICT in agricultural sector. In particular, it explores the benefits of ICT in terms of agriculture smartness and sustainability, provides an overview on the main technologies used, delineates the contours of the smart farming market and landscape, and analyses the potential drawbacks of such a ‘digital revolution’ in agriculture. Smart agriculture is presented by some scholars and practitioners as the ‘Third Green Revolution’, after the plant breeding and genetics revolutions. It is widely recognised that ICTs can help reducing inefficiencies, increasing resource productivity, decreasing management costs, and improving traceability and transparency. However, some caution is needed to make the ongoing ‘digital revolution’ in agriculture inclusive for small-scale farmers and women, especially in developing countries. Moreover, some threats and challenges relating to digital and smart technologies need to be appropriately addressed through policies to support the development of the necessary market and legal architecture for ICT and smart farming, with due consideration to ethical questions. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020."
Khrais L.T.,IoT and blockchain in the development of smart cities,2020,"With the advent and proliferation of the internet, the fourth industrial revolution is in full swing. As a result, different technologies have the potential to impact the course of human development. In other words, worldwide populations are moving towards growing urban centers and as a result, smart cities are emerging as the integration of human activities and technologies. These smart cities are built on top of different technologies such as blockchain and the Internet of Things (IoT). Consequently, the applications of these technologies in current and future smart cities will not only change the nature of human interaction and governance but also how business is conducted. This paper proposes an experimental study (qualitative and quantitative) that will determine the impact of blockchain and IoT technologies on the development of smart cities. It aims to derive insight from questions such as how current business models are preparing themselves for this disruption, the challenges they will face, and the potential contributions the two technologies will have on business development. The study's outcomes will provide the rationale for why businesses should start paying attention to these technologies and start on an early adoption plan that will slowly transform their business models as smart cities mature. © Science and Information Organization."

"Rao M.S., Chakraborty G., Murthy K.S.",Market Drivers and Discovering Technologies in Meat Species Identification,2019,"Changing demographics and the need to know what we eat has fueled a drastic rise in consumer awareness and hence the demand for certification by government and regulatory bodies. The inceptions of regulations in emerging economies like India and China that have entered the global food trade are expected to increase the demand for testing services. Due to the sheer volume of the global meat market, there has been focus on technologies for meat speciation, like immunoassay-based techniques and electrophoretic techniques. However, by virtue of their intrinsic constraints, these technologies have been superseded by the recent molecular DNA-based methods. DNA-based technologies, mainly polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR (RTPCR), are in the spotlight because of their quantitative capabilities, better sensitivity, and rapidity. Next-generation sequencing (NGS), a high-throughput sequencing method, has revolutionized meat speciation studies in terms of speed, read length, and throughput, along with cost-reduction. Variants of chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques are an attractive option due to the speed of analysis and minimal sample preparation but they fail to quantify adulteration in cases such as cooked meat, which has more complex chromatographic patterns. Even with the advent of these methods, consumers need to be vigorously assured that players across the supply network are operating in the consumer’s interest and not in their own financial gain. Under the Blockchain system of technology, traceability of the end product is feasible at every point of its processing or packaging and all the data can be retrieved in less than 2 min. Considering the intersection of the largest target segment, meat, and the fastest growing technology, PCR-based technology, this review intends to provide an updated overview, of market and research studies for authenticity, and a short summary of traceability systems to enhance trade transparency. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

With the widespread of a very small business model and the Internet, online shopping has become part of people's daily activity. People browse for desirable products at the comfort of their homes and ask the online vendor that a shipper can deliver the merchandise at their doorstep. Then, COD allows customers to pay in cash when the product is delivered to their desired location. Since customers receive goods before making a payment, COD is, therefore, considered as a payment system. However, the crucial issue that previous research has not yet addressed is that their models only support single delivering session at a time. More precisely, if the current buyer is not available to receive the goods, the shipper has to wastefully wait for the complete payment and he/she cannot start shipping another merchandise. The tracking system seems to poorly handle this issue. In particular, we propose a multi-session mechanism, which consists of blockchain technology, smart contracts and hyperledger fabric platform to achieve distributed and transparent across delivering sessions in the decentralized markets. Our proposed mechanism ensure the efficiency of delivering process. The authors release our sources codes for further reproducibility and development. We conclude that the integration of multi-session mechanism and blockchain technology will cause significant efficiency across several disciplines. © 2018 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited."
Greiman V.,Navigating the cyber sea: Dangerous atolls ahead,2019,"The maritime domain is a vast network of cargo ships, crude oil tanks, chemical tankers, container ships, passenger ships, insurance companies, offshore and onshore operators, port operators, national and international authorities, military forces, navigation experts, maritime management, satellite and communication systems, that must work together to prevent maritime cyber-attacks and manage the impacts of attacks when they occur. Ships are increasingly using systems that rely on digitization, integration, and automation, which calls for cyber risk management on and off-shore. As of 2017, there were more than 52,000 merchant ships sailing the Cyber Seas. Despite the increased danger of cyber-attacks on the high seas and in sea ports around the globe, internationally binding cybersecurity regulations for the maritime industry have not been adopted. However, effective risk management in the maritime sector, specifically to identify, assess, detect, respond to and recover has been recently raised by the United Nations International Maritime Organization (IMO) in its 2016 Guidelines on maritime cybersecurity. Technological advances in the shipping industry, such as autonomous ships, drones, robotics, various blockchain applications, and deep level machine learning hold considerable promise for the supply side of shipping. However, there is still uncertainty within the maritime industry regarding possible safety, security and cybersecurity incidents, as well as concern about the diminishing role of seafarers, mostly from the developing world. As the future of technological advances in shipping is expanded, the existing legal, policy and regulatory frameworks must be adapted and new frameworks written, as required, at both the national and international levels. The strategic plan for the International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted in December 2017 recognizes the need to integrate new and emerging technologies into the regulatory framework for shipping. The evolution of the Belt and Road Initiative in the South China Sea also bear major implications for the shipping and maritime trade, as do recent regulatory requirements governing cyber security and privacy rights in the European Union. Through empirical evidence this paper explores the legal implications including the rights and duties of the maritime industry in protecting against unlawful intrusions into cyber systems, while at the same time advancing recommendations for legal frameworks and regulations essential to ensure safety and security on the Cyber Sea. © 2019 14th International Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security, ICCWS 2019.

"Nguyen T.Q., Das A.K., Tran L.T.",NEO Smart Contract for Drought-Based Insurance,2019,"Agriculture insurance has developed across emerging economies in South East Asia (SEA). New products are introduced to farmers to lessen financial losses of crops with low commercialised. Drought-based crop insurance has launched in some SEA countries to protect farmers from extreme weather events. The evaluation process for insurance value coverage is costly and lengthy. Farmer participation in crop insurance schemes, hence, remains low. Additionally, while dealing with extreme events, stated-owned irrigation water companies with complex bureaucratic systems delay decisions. This adds a heavy toll on farmers' shoulders when facing drought. To solve these problems, a blockchain-based smart contract linking with oracle services to ensure asymmetric information is proposed to reduce the evaluation costs and lengthy process of evaluating compensation is a. Currently, building smart contract that oracles can push required information to is not used in the case of agricultural insurance. Hence, we proposed a blockchain-based smart contract framework that applies to weather-based index insurance. We selected NEO for our experiment due to its easy access tokens. While developing a smart contract on NEO, we designed 5 functions that can be triggered if certain conditions are met and built a virtual oracles server. This initial experiment promised a scalable and trusted platform that can lessen farmers' potential damages and reduce their vulnerability. © 2019 IEEE."
Y. Lu; Q. Tang; G. Wang,On Enabling Machine Learning Tasks atop Public Blockchains: A Crowdsourcing Approach,2018,"The recently emerged blockchain (in particular smart contract) technology offers an enticing opportunity for decentralized sharing economy. Machine learning can be one important subroutine in such a decentralized ecosystem. Unfortunately, machine learning programs are usually computational intensive as well as randomized, which fall into the inherent limitations of open blockchain where complex and randomized programs cannot be executed by the underlying nodes collectively. Given also the limitations of existing verifiable computing techniques, we propose a crowdsourcing idea from the game theoretic perspective to resolve the tension. We design a simple incentive mechanism so that the execution of a wide range of complex programs can be crowdsourced via the blockchain, and any false computing result could be deterred. In particular, our protocol works in the scenarios that there is no trusted third-party involved; Moreover, our protocol not only works in the classical model of non-colluding service providers, but also can tolerate any potential coalition up to n-1, where n is the total number of service providers. We also showcase how to use our protocol to crowdsource two typical kinds of machine learning tasks via open blockchain. We envision that our solution is not only promising to launch decentralized applications involving a wide range of machine learning programs, but also a stepping stone towards a general way to empowering intensive and randomized computations atop the open blockchain."

At the same time, most African economies continue to be at the tail end of global financial innovations adoption. Given lagging consumer adoption of cryptocurrency in South Africa, the purpose of this paper is to apply the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) to predict behavioural intention to adopt cryptocurrency. Design/methodology/approach A survey instrument based on the TPB was used to collect quantitative data for predicting adoption from adult distance students at the Mancosa, Cape Town campus. For data analysis, the two-step structural equation modelling approach was used. Findings The findings indicate that attitude and perceived behavioural control positively impact the intention to adopt cryptocurrency. Subjective norm showed a negative non-significant influence. Overall, the results of the study show that the model has a good model fit and can be used to explain the theory. Originality/value The contribution of this paper is threefold: it is one of a few studies on the behavioural intention to adopt cryptocurrency in South Africa using the TPB model, it contributes towards the use of predictive behavioural economics models in understanding consumer behaviour critical to accelerating the adoption of financial innovations, and the results of the study also inform behaviour change strategies that can be applied by practitioners or policymakers to improve adoption. Studies of this nature may lead to the development of financial innovation in emerging markets through a nuanced understanding of consumer behaviour."

The protocol integrates a service against the diversion of objectives which is based on smart contract. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2020."
"Ricci P., Mammanco V.",RemBit: A blockchain based solution for remittances to Ethiopia,2019,"Since its introduction in the Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin white paper published in 2008, blockchain technology has been seen as a great opportunity to enable new business scenarios both for developed and developing countries. Considering that digital alternative payment methods represent a key factor to the smart cities development, in this study we propose an innovative payment solution aimed at improving the remittance flows by exploiting the potential of blockchain technology. Traditional banking remittance systems are characterized by high transaction fees and long transfer times, therefore they encourage the adoption of informal channels for money transfer with consequent losses in the economic system. By focusing our interest in a specific country of Sub-Saharan Africa, Ethiopia, we launch an innovative blockchain based system able to make the remittance process safer, faster and to allow secure and reliable transactions between the counterparts in data sharing. We describe its architecture, which enables a secure management of big data and the different stages of solution design. Furthermore, the system guarantees the compliance with the Ethiopian government's recommendations on the matter, in particular it allows to encourage formal data collection on remittances and to support the introduction of new technology in the payments system. In addition, its use by individuals could improve awareness and financial education in Ethiopia and it can help prevent money laundering and financing of terrorism. © 2019 IEEE."

"Upadhyaya, P; Upadhyay, SK; Subedi, B; Subedi, B; Gaire, A",Revolutionizing healthcare systems of a developing country using Blockchain,2018,"In present days, data security and citizen privacy are the vulnerable areas globally. Amongst them, healthcare systems are the most targeted ones. In Nepal, among the few ehealth systems available, most are disconnected, fragmented and cyber security aspect is overlooked, creating even more risk. To effectively guide health care systems and make it more citizen-centric, centralized secured online healthcare system is essential. This study proposes a centralized, permissioned Blockchain based secured healthcare system using hyperledger for developing countries. This system follows distributed storage technology to facilitate better availability, redundancy and strong confidentiality using cryptographic encryption. Besides, this technique creates a transparent yet secure and immutable data storage and sharing platform. It optimally and effectively contributes to the transfer of health information that is cost effective. Regarding it, a pilot study was performed taking a tertiary care hospital; Hospital for Children, Eye, ENT and Rehabilitation Services (CHEERS) and its community hospital at Chapagaun. It was validated using the balanced scorecard to confirm its cost-effective performance. Nineteen most essential key progress indicators were chosen for study. From this study, it was deduced that transforming internal business process of a hospital setting by implementing proposed healthcare system results in 75% customer satisfaction as well as 63% financial gain. This approach uplifts the healthcare organizations and their financial status. It, in turn, sets a benchmark for a secured health care system of developing countries as a whole."

Food safety and its supply are also drawing the world attention towards its importance and people are focusing on it because of health hazards. In this research, we have presented a model for the uplift of traditional agriculture field to smart farming, considering blockchain with IoT technology. This system promises to provide equal opportunity to all stakeholders involved in the agricultural food supply chain; even they are not interconnected. IoT devices are added to the smart model to reduce human interference for data collection, recording and verification. The validation of our novel model is compared with our own scheme utilizing only IoT devices deployed in the monitoring field without block-chain."
B. Li; Y. Wang,RZKPB: A Privacy-Preserving Blockchain-Based Fair Transaction Method for Sharing Economy,2018,"Emerging blockchain systems have been widely adopted in sharing economy, such as e-commerce, to allow mutually distrustful parties to transact fairly without trusted parties. Most blockchain systems, however, lack transactional privacy protection. All transactions, including trading relationship between pseudonyms and content transacted, are exposed on the blockchain. Although many existing privacy protection methods on the blockchain have been proposed, it is difficult to find a trade-off between keeping speed and protecting privacy of transactions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel privacy-preserving method RZKPB that does not store financial transactions in clear on the blockchain, thus retaining transactional privacy from the public's view. Meanwhile, these transactions are as proofs to solve disputes between trading partners. RZKPB ensures fairness and privacy of transactions between participants without adding a new trusted party and breaking the verifying protocol on the blockchain. We take the e-commerce as an example in sharing economy to introduce RZKPB in our paper. Our experimental results show that compared with existing privacy-preserving methods based on the blockchain, RZKPB is more efficient under different settings."
"Iqbal R., Butt T.A.",Safe farming as a service of blockchain-based supply chain management for improved transparency,2020,"Precision agriculture is based on the idea of utilizing technology to improve the efficiency of agriculture industry. Blockchain technology has great potential to revolutionize the agricultural industry. Furthermore, various Internet of Things (IoT) based solutions are proposed to enhance production such as crops condition monitoring system. These technologies aim to address various stages of the agricultural supply chain by improving the processes. The key issue faced by farmers is to ensure the protection of their crops from animals during all stages of a harvest. This paper proposes a IoT-based prevention system to tackle this issue for safe farming. The solution is based on the input of the sensor nodes deployed in the field to detect animal attacks. These sensors report a hazard to a Repelling and Notifying System (RNS) in the field. The RNS produces human-safe ultrasonic sound waves that are unbearable for animals, thus they leave the field. The proposed RNS system also reports all hazard incidents to a centralized Farm Management System (FMS) maintained by the farmer. The paper also proposes a way the FMS can add value to a broader arena by becoming a service to an Agricultural Blockchain system. As a blockchain node, the FMS maintains a shared ledger as part of blockchain to share the details of incidents with meta information with other nodes in the blockchain. This information is vital for other blockchain nodes of the agricultural blockchain such as other FMS, companies, authorities and standard bodies. The low-cost RNS performance evaluation concludes that it is power efficient that makes it even affordable for developing countries, and as a Blockchain service it enables novel applications for the agriculture industry. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
R. Radhakrishnan; G. S. Ramachandran; B. Krishnamachari,SDPP: Streaming Data Payment Protocol for Data Economy,2019,"Applications in the area of IoT and smart cities rely heavily on data to manage and control their operational environments. In such applications, machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms help the government officials, city administrators, and industries to make an informed decision on managing their cities and factories using the data collected from various sources. As we step into the era where â€data is termed as new oilâ€, there is a need for protocols with support for selling and buying data without giving up the data ownership to third-parties. In this demo, we present Streaming Data Payment Protocol (SDPP), which is an application layer protocol for selling and buying data. SDPP uses blockchain and distributed ledger technology for micropayments and immutable storage of transaction records. In addition, our protocol has a built-in mechanism to set data granularity since the bulk transfer of data between a seller and a buyer may lead to a loss for the seller if the buyer terminates the connection after receiving the data without making a payment. In this demo, we present SDPP and explain how it can contribute to the emerging data economy using a proof-of-concept implementation that uses TCP protocol for data communication and IOTA as both cryptocurrency and a distributed ledger."

"Lamichhane M., Sadov O., Zaslavsky A.",Smart waste management system: A fusion of IoT and blockchain technology,2018,"Blockchain technology and Internet of Things (IoT) are two of the most popular technologies today. IoT is an interconnection of devices that can communicate with each other. It can help create smart solutions that can enhance the quality of life of people. Likewise, blockchain is distributed database systems that promise high level of security and availability of data with least transaction overhead. In this paper, we attempt to bring together these two technologies to develop a smart waste management system. The scope of implementation of such smart solutions to real-life problems is limited by the lack of proper payment infrastructure that can support micropayments in return of services. Current financial systems have problems dealing with micropayments due to large overhead cost of transactions. Blockchain technology could be a reasonable solution to overcome such a problem. It can help lower the transaction cost and time thus lowering cost of services in general, which can specially impact developing countries. The proposed smart waste management (SWM) system uses latest development in blockchain like smart contracts, decentralized autonomous organization, and its own cryptocurrency to handle the investment and service charges while it uses simulated smart garbage bin with QR-reader that communicates to the central server using MQTT, a popular IoT protocol. Furthermore, a Telegram Bot running in telegram messaging application helps user interact with the SWM system.

The authors explored the main benefits for business entities of using SMART contracts as a digital tool for automating a large number of business processes in the DLT-system. Among with this, the potential risks for conducting the business activity of SMEs were considered, which could be exemplified as lack of legislation, high volatility of cryptocurrency, attenuation of monitoring level, etc. The usage of blockchain Smart contracts as the part of machine learning could lead to become SME Smarter, more dynamic, more flexible and more integrated with big data, which presupposes innovative component of business development. In the context of Smart specialization implementation in developing countries in EU, the Cooperative Model between different stakeholders based on SMART contracts in the frame of Smart specialization was designed and proposed by the authors. This Model allows to involve non-top developed regions into the innovative process. Besides SMEs' participation, the Model provides cooperation between other participants: research and innovative centers, universities, government structures, non-government organization, big corporations. It was studied how SMART contracts make review the business process and revolutionize it, improving difficult collaborations between business and science organizations.

At the same time, blockchain-based cryptocurrency is becoming a nonnegligible type of currency and the total value of all types of cryptocurrency has reached USD 200 billion. Therefore, it is a natural demand to support cryptocurrency payment on mobile devices. Considering the poor infrastructure and low penetration of financial service in developing countries, this combination is especially attractive. The high storage cost and payment processing latency are the two main obstacles for mobile payment using cryptocurrency. We propose two different schemes for cryptocurrency mobile payment, one involves a centralized bank and the other one does not require any centralized party. We also provide a solution for the bank to meet KYC (know your customer)/AML (antimoney laundering) compliance requirements when it is involved in cryptocurrency mobile payment processing. © 2019 IEEE."

M. Quayson; C. Bai; J. Sarkis,Technology for Social Good Foundations: A Perspective From the Smallholder Farmer in Sustainable Supply Chains,2020,"The livelihood of smallholder farmers in emerging economiesâ€™ cocoa supply chain is substandard because of fraud, exploitation, corruption, deceit, child labor, and financial exclusion, usually perpetrated by influential actors. This situation creates a social sustainability problem which needs urgent attention. Digital technologies such as sensors, drones, satellites, and blockchain show promise toward fostering social sustainability deep into the supply chain. This innovation is consistent with the United Nations 2030 sustainable development goals of transforming world economies toward a more sustainable future vision by reducing poverty and inequality. As our contribution, we adopt a traditional approach in our perspective article to initiate a scholarly curiosity to discuss and develop research needs on how to use technology to address this current and critical sustainability and supply chain concern. Blockchain can solve the inefficiencies, complexities, and other social issues of smallholder farmers in the supply chain. This article identifies some blockchain technologies in emerging economies, such as Hara Technology in Indonesia and Cellulant Agrikore Blockchain Solution in Nigeria. Again, we observed that the promise of using technology to improve smallholders' vulnerability in the cocoa supply chain remains underexploited in Africa and other emerging economies. Therefore, rigorous research on smallholders' social sustainability is needed to make sound policy recommendations. This short perspective article describes issues facing these smallholder farmers and how technology can play a role for them and their supply chains to alleviate various social and environmental concerns. Accordingly, we propose some research questions for technology, innovation, and engineering management researchers."
"Davies F.T., Garrett B.",Technology for Sustainable Urban Food Ecosystems in the Developing World: Strengthening the Nexus of Food–Water–Energy–Nutrition,2018,"Smart integration of technology can help create sustainable urban food ecosystems (UFEs) for the rapidly expanding urban population in the developing world. Technology, especially recent advances in digital-enabled devices based on internet connectivity, are essential for building UFEs at a time when food production is increasingly limited on a global scale by the availability of land, water, and energy. By 2050, two-thirds of the world will be urban—and most of the net world population growth will occur in urban regions in the developing world. A food crisis is looming, with the developing world ill-prepared to sustainably feed itself. We identify 12 innovative technology platforms to advance the UFEs of the developing world: (1) connectivity—information delivery and digital technology platforms; (2) uberized services; (3) precision agriculture (GPS, IoT—Internet of things, AI—artificial intelligence, sensing technology); (4) CEA—controlled environment agriculture, including vertical farms; (5) blockchain for greater transparency, food safety, and identification; (6) solar and wind power connected to microgrids; (7) high-quality, enhanced seeds for greater yield, nutrition, climate, and pest resistance; (8) advanced genetics, including gene editing, synthetic biology, and cloud biology; (9) biotechnology, including microbiome editing, soil biologicals, cultured meat, alternative proteins to meat and dairy; (10) nanotechnology and advanced materials; (11) 3-D printing/additive manufacturing; and (12) integration of new tech to scale-up underutilized, existing technologies.

"Ning X., Ramirez R., Khuntia J.",Technology to shape social policy: Blockchain for targeted poverty alleviation,2019,"Poverty remains a critical problem in many developing countries. In response, ‘No Poverty’ is the first of seventeen 2030 sustainable development goal (SDG) adopted by all member states of the United Nations in 2015. Given the transparency and auditability features of blockchain, this emerging technology has been suggested as one solution for enabling the no poverty goal. Unfortunately, research on this topic is sparse. In this exploratory study, we investigate how the use of blockchain can facilitate targeted poverty alleviation using a case study of practices in the Chinese city of Guiyang. We apply Giddens’ structuration theory in the examination of the case data and find that (1) blockchain application is the outcome of structuration of structure (policies and resources) and the human agents (stakeholders); (2) blockchain enables empowerment and makes surveillance bi-directional; and (3) blockchain application is an ongoing process, with a comprehensive and dynamic viewpoint being critically important. © 2019 Association for Information Systems.

One possibility is a more successful implementation of the state socialist vision of a centrally managed economy, possibly controlled by an AGI “Nanny” instead of a central committee of politicians. An alternative outcome, more in keeping with the original Marxist vision of the withering away of the state, may be the mutualist vision of organizing economic and social life along voluntary lines. A number of recent developments and new ideas may facilitate this outcome. The institution of the commons, in the past available only to small geographical communities, can now be used by global communities. Open collaboration and exchange networks facilitate voluntary cooperative activity by people at dispersed physical locations. Open Production Networks can make the most complicated economic exchanges transparent to consumers, allowing them to factor ethical and sociological considerations into their purchasing decisions. Offer Networks can help people with similar interests and complementary abilities to organize joint projects and organizations. Blockchain technologies could be used to create transparent currencies in which transactions can be done openly.

"Kankanam Pathiranage H.S., Xiao H., Li W.",The inefficiencies of bitcoins in developing countries,2020,"Cryptocurrency is an emerging phenomenon set to revolutionize the financial industry. It utilizes blockchain technology, which ensures data is immutable, transparent and reliable. Cryptocurrency is present in different forms like Blockchain and is present in most parts of the world. Developed nations have a significant interest in technology and have put a measure to investigate while developing nations are also following suit. The global interest in cryptocurrency is associated with the fact that the movement of money will be traceable and it will minimize activities such as money laundering and corruption. The paper analyzes a selected period of six years to establish the efficiency of the Blockchain in the markets. A graph and tables are essential in generating more data for interpretation of the events. The tests used in the analysis are the Ljung-box, R/S Hurst, BDS, Runs, AVR test, and Bartels tests. All the tests demonstrated inefficiencies in the Bitcoin trend, especially in the full sample and slightly low inefficiency in the later subsample. The conclusion made is that bitcoin will improve its efficiency over time as it is an emerging industry that needs to grow. Developing countries experience higher inefficiency combined with the prevalent policy challenges and issues like corruption and unemployment. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

We put forward a policy framework that can potentially address these three questions and in addition could represent a critical step towards a circular economy eliminating the need for a post-resource discussion. Using precious metals as an example, we present a novel concept that combines policy, business and technological aspects aimed at making efficient use of finite resources and distributing the revenue more evenly. This approach could hence create jobs and eliminate the need of a post-resource discussion for post-industrial economies. Moreover, we will illustrate herein how this approach could be the initial step of the leapfrogging to a post-resource economy with maximized employment. Furthermore, the advance of some emerging technologies, such as block chain and associated smart contracts could be leveraged to track the primary asset being leased. We also note the broader impact on sustainability and economics with the implications of such a model in driving a circular economy, encouraging GDP growth, addressing resource “scarcity” and on the environment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"
Ramírez S.A.H.,"The new global governance in the aerospace industry: New technological capabilities in Brazil, China and Canada",2019,"The aerospace industry has two industrial subsectors: Aeronautics and Space. The leading countries in this global value chain (GVC) present a holistic perception of this indissoluble binomial. However, there are learner countries which have been integrated in an unprecedented way into Aeronautics. Therefore, this paradigm break is the reason why this investigation was conducted. The “technological capability” concept builds an architecture that fully supports the relation between technological and governance development in Politics, Commerce and Society. Therefore, on this research, a theoretical approach of Science and Technology in the field of Social Sciences and International Relations was developed with the purpose of generating an adequate analysis framework based on the Governance Theory, Open Innovation and Technological Capabilities literature. This framework served to analyze three case studies, such as Brazil, Canada and China. As intermediate industrial leaders in the manufacture of regional aircraft, despite having a different technological trajectory, their technical capabilities impacted on the GVC, thus generating a new governance in local institutions and international organizations. In these three cases, not only favorable conditions have emerged, but also, they faced a poor management regarding public policies. As a result, it was found that this atmosphere is called as a National Innovation System (NIS) and it is a methodological turning point to analyze the technological transfer, adoption and assimilation in developing countries, which could lead to finished products for the space sector. In the three case studies, the main interest was a military, political and industrial integration. However, considering the Industry 4.0 and a global technological convergence, it is concluded that the aerospace industry has become a multicausal and multisectoral phenomenon when integrating new advanced functionalities such as Blockchain, Big Data, Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Analytics. This technological enablement has led to industry good practices in Aeronautics regarding discrete manufacturing and B2B2C services; as for the space sector concerning Remote Sensing for disaster management, public health, communications and climate change studies. All the previous based on an open innovation economy, which is nourished not only by an inter-business dynamic, but also by external data sources. Now the challenges of this reformulation will revolve around integration, global standards, systems interoperability and data security (GDPR). The NIS will then have to be able to manage these factors to achieve both commercial competitiveness and the guarantee of a social benefit.

Korneychuk B.,The political economy of the blockchain society,2018,"The review discusses the political-economic aspects of the concept of distributed capitalism allowed for by blockchain technology. As opposed to the first era of the Internet, where the industry of financial and information services was dominated by intermediaries, the blockchain era is characterized by development of a new institution of trust; disruption of financial intermediation; economic inclusion of hundreds of millions of citizens in developing countries; an increase in competition and a decrease in inequality. The paper focuses on the content of key political-economic categories being redefined in the blockchain era. First, labor value gives way to creative value which is manifesting itself in cryptocurrencies. Second, exploitation of workers is replaced by digital discrimination. The blockchain revolution is a solution to the problem of discrimination against intellectual property creators, who have to hand over a large part of the value created to intermediaries. Third, capitalism characterized by information monopoly gives place to free competition based on rivalry between cryptocurrencies. Fourth, class struggle is substituted by confrontation between agents of information monopoly system and those of distributed economy. The author considers the main opposition to distributed capitalism to stem from the feudal financial system which loses ground under new conditions, where economic agents may use alternative currencies and interact directly with one other without risk and high transaction costs. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018."
M. N. Patwary; S. Junaid Nawaz; M. A. Rahman; S. K. Sharma; M. M. Rashid; S. J. Barnes,The Potential Short- and Long-Term Disruptions and Transformative Impacts of 5G and Beyond Wireless Networks: Lessons Learnt From the Development of a 5G Testbed Environment,2020,"The capacity and coverage requirements for 5th generation (5G) and beyond wireless connectivity will be significantly different from the predecessor networks. To meet these requirements, the anticipated deployment cost in the United Kingdom (UK) is predicted to be between Â£30bn and Â£50bn, whereas the current annual capital expenditure (CapEX) of the mobile network operators (MNOs) is Â£2.5bn. This prospect has vastly impacted and has become one of the major delaying factors for building the 5G physical infrastructure, whereas other areas of 5G are progressing at their speed. Due to the expensive and complicated nature of the network infrastructure and spectrum, the second-tier operators, widely known as mobile virtual network operators (MVNO), are entirely dependent on the MNOs. In this paper, an extensive study is conducted to explore the possibilities of reducing the 5G deployment cost and developing viable business models. In this regard, the potential of infrastructure, data, and spectrum sharing is thoroughly investigated. It is established that the use of existing public infrastructure (e.g., streetlights, telephone poles, etc.) has a potential to reduce the anticipated cost by about 40% to 60%. This paper also reviews the recent Ofcom initiatives to release location-based licenses of the 5G-compatible radio spectrum. Our study suggests that simplification of infrastructure and spectrum will encourage the exponential growth of scenario-specific cellular networks (e.g., private networks, community networks, micro-operators) and will potentially disrupt the current business models of telecommunication business stakeholders - specifically MNOs and TowerCos. Furthermore, the anticipated dense device connectivity in 5G will increase the resolution of traditional and non-traditional data availability significantly. This will encourage extensive data harvesting as a business opportunity and function within small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as large social networks. Consequently, the rise of new infrastructures and spectrum stakeholders is anticipated. This will fuel the development of a 5G data exchange ecosystem where data transactions are deemed to be high-value business commodities. The privacy and security of such data, as well as definitions of the associated revenue models and ownership, are challenging areas - and these have yet to emerge and mature fully. In this direction, this paper proposes the development of a unified data hub with layered structured privacy and security along with blockchain and encrypted off-chain based ownership/royalty tracking. Also, a data economy-oriented business model is proposed. The study found that with the potential commodification of data and data transactions along with the low-cost physical infrastructure and spectrum, the 5G network will introduce significant disruption in the Telco business ecosystem."
Treacher M.,The role of digital assets in global payments,2018,"This paper examines the role of digital ledger technologies (DLT) and their underlying digital assets in the arena of global payments, arguing that digital assets can make such payments faster, less expensive and more efficient.The paper begins by describing the state of cross-border transactions today, highlighting the often piecemeal development of systems that have led to today’s network of walled gardens corresponding to national borders and currencies. It also discusses DLT solutions that are being tested to overcome these limitations. However, this technology alone cannot overcome liquidity issues in local markets — especially emerging markets. Presently, banks and payment providers resolve these issues by prefunding accounts in local currencies on both sides of a transaction, using something called nostro accounts. This is where digital assets can deliver a clear advantage when used in combination with DLT. Acting as a bridge currency, digital assets can create the necessary pools of liquidity and enable direct transactions. The future of cross-border payments will then be realised through the combination of DLT and digital assets. In this way, banks and payment providers can quickly and easily complete affordable, transparent, real-time transactions. This promise is already being tested by early adopters, and is projected to grow exponentially throughout 2018. © Henry Stewart Publications, 1750-1806."
"Kehr H., Tonkin G., Bihler R.",The unbanked don’t need more brick and mortar banks,2016,"‘Disruption’ is a word used more often as we see digital solutions solve age-old problems with a substantially cheaper and more convenient product than the one in place. Whether in communication, ride-sharing, or nearly any other industry, the implications of quickly evolving technologies have added complexity to traditional businesses, which find it difficult to keep up with such rapid advancements. The cost of building brick and mortar networks across large, sparsely populated areas with low household incomes is not economically viable and has led to the exclusion of two billion people from accessing financial tools such as savings and investment accounts. New technologies, such as the bitcoin blockchain, appear to be a viable solution in a lucrative position to revolutionize the financial sector just as the internet revolutionized the communication sector in the early 1990s. By using a combination of new technologies, including the bitcoin blockchain and cryptofinancial technologies, financial service providers have the opportunity to offer full financial services to an entire population without having to build a single physical bank. Because of the added security and the possibility of risk-free finance, customers will be able to make low value transfers under $0.01 to anyone, anywhere, at nearly no cost. The internet has made worldwide communication cheaply, easily, and instantly accessible for nearly everyone on the planet. A new era of mobile services using crypto-technologies has the ability to do the same for the financial sector. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017."

However, Cash-on-Delivery (COD) payment method still prevails in cash-based economies. Although COD allows consumers to be more proactive in making payments, it still appears to be vulnerable by the appearance of a third party (shipping companies). In this paper, we proposed a payment system based on ""smart contract"" implemented on top of blockchain technology to minimize risks for parties. The platform consists of a set of rules that each party must follow including specific delivery time and place, cost of delivery, mortgage money; thereby, forcing parties to be responsible for their tasks in order to complete the contract.

DANDJINOU,Towards Blockchain Services For Mobile Money Traceability And Federation,2019,"This paper discusses a new approach to mobile money, a money transfer solution via mobile phone, which uses accounts associated with SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) identifiers, and which are managed by the Mobile Network Operators (MNOs). The first solution launched in Kenya in 2007, M-PESA is one of the world major mobile money services. Mobile money becomes the new monopoly of MMOs in an economic system where the rate of unbanked adults is very high. Currently in 2019 Orange Money makes nearly 1.5 million transactions per day, which corresponds to a monetary value of nearly 15 billion CFA francs per day. The USSD is the technology at the heart of the Mobile-money transactions. Blockchain, which is the underlying technology of the first crypto currency Bitcoin, has drawn a lot of global attention in recent years. Blockchain does not stop seeing its field of action widen. The field of action of the Blockchain has not yet completed its enlargement. The rate of unbanked is still very high in developing countries; this rate is a factor that does not favor the emergence of the economy. It is necessary to count on the mobile money to skip this obstacle (according to the World Bank) we make here the state of the art on the mobile money and its underlying technologies in the sub-Saharan countries and in Burkina-Faso. We propose a mobile-money solution based on the Blockchain, in order to increase security, trust, and move towards a federation of mobile-money platforms."

Zulkernine,Trust-Based Cooperative Game Model for Secure Collaboration in the Internet of Vehicles,2019,"The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is an emerging computing paradigm that delivers intelligent transportation services. In an IoV system, the legitimacy, reliability, and accuracy of circulating data have a direct impact on decisions and operations, and eventually, public safety and economy. In this paper, we design a decentralized secure collaboration scheme that protects the vehicles in the IoV environment against the attacks on data integrity. First, the trustworthiness of the vehicles is computed based on their experience acquired from direct interactions using a Bayesian inference model. Then, based on the established trust relationships between the vehicles, we present a vehicular coalition formation approach that incorporates a hedonic cooperative game model, which aims at preventing malicious or faulty vehicles from joining benign vehicular collaborative communities. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme is highly resilient to data alteration and corruption attacks. The scheme also demonstrates to be scalable, and will ultimately allow the IoV entities and platform to derive optimal operative decisions on the fly."
Lemieux V.L.,Trusting records: is Blockchain technology the answer?,2016,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the value of Blockchain technology as a solution to creating and preserving trustworthy digital records, presenting some of the limitations, risks and opportunities of the approach. Design/methodology/approach: The methodological approach involves using the requirements embedded in records management and digital preservation standards, specifically ISO 15,489, ARMA’s Generally Accepted Recordkeeping Principles, ISO 14,721 and ISO 16,363, as a general evaluative framework for a risk-based assessment of a specific proposed implementation of Blockchain technology for a land registry system in a developing country. Findings: The results of the analysis suggest that Blockchain technology can be used to address issues associated with information integrity in the present and near term, assuming proper security architecture and infrastructure management controls. It does not, however, guarantee reliability of information in the first place, and would have several limitations as a long-term solution for maintaining trustworthy digital records.

The project has primarily remained an initiative of four major participating states - i.e. India, Iran, Azerbaijan and Russia that are territorially located along the route of the corridor. Private businesses, whether local companies or multinational corporations, have not been very interested to jointly develop the project, mostly out of their concerns for assured returns on investments. The study builds a comprehensive case for the participating states to actively engage the private companies for developing the mega-connectivity project. The latter holds an advantage over advanced digital technologies in the global markets. Hence, public-private partnerships will bring about application of advanced digital technologies, like IoT, Blockchain technology, etc., which will efficiently serve the needs of different activities happening along the entire length of the corridor.

Their capacity to facilitate secure and disintermediated value transfer through crypto-code and smart contracts enables novel forms of remittance transfer, resource management and digital identity verification – and may also generate new vulnerabilities. In this article, we examine the use of emerging blockchain applications in various migration and diaspora related initiatives in the emerging economies of Africa, Asia and Europe. By building on existing social networks of mutual obligation and quasi-ethnic affinities, blockchain technologies may facilitate the ability to enlarge the scope of diasporas and change the nature of belonging, sovereignty, migration and statehood. Through exploring the selective foregrounding of mutuality and materiality in such alternative value transfer systems, we seek to explain the dynamics of trust and agency that these networks generate to extend commitments and loyalties in the transnational space. © 2018 Global Networks Partnership & John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

,,,"Electric vehicles (EVs) have transformed the smart transportation sector by providing diverse energy management solutions to the smart grid. Energy trading among EVs and charging stations (CS) in a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) environment is one of the popular verticals in smart grid. However, processing the energy trading decisions at remote control centers lead to an increase in delay and network overhead. Apart from these issues, the security concerns while trading the energy in such an environment remain persistent. Therefore, to handle the aforementioned issues, this paper presents SURVIVOR: A Blockchain based Edge-as-a-Service Framework for Secure Energy Trading in software defined networking (SDN)-enabled V2G Environment. In the proposed framework, the energy trading decisions are processed closer to the location of EVs through edge nodes. Moreover, for securing the energy trading transactions, blockchain is used wherein the approver nodes are selected amongst all the present nodes on the basis of a utility function and are made responsible for validating the transactions. Once such nodes are selected, a consensus-based blockchain mechanism for secure energy trading in SDN-enabled V2G environment is presented. In this mechanism, edge nodes are responsible for generating proof-of-work puzzles. The proof-of-work is a unique hash value which is computed for each EV and the transactions for which the approver nodes compute the same proof-of-work for each EV are added in the blockchain. The complete scheme is backed by the SDN architecture to reduce the overall latency and increase the throughput of the smart transportation network. The results obtained prove that the proposed scheme is effective for trading the energy between EVs and CS while securing the underlying trading transactions using blockchain. Moreover, the communication and computation cost of the proposed scheme comes out to be small which proves that it can be used in real-world applications. The latency in the complete transportation sector is also greatly reduced by using the SDN-architecture."
,,,"The bitcoin blockchain provides the new ability to securely transact in the transfer of value or data without intermediaries, and is indispensible when the distribution of influence is valuable or preferred over centralized operations. With blockchain technology, the ledger necessary to verify and record identity and asset ownership for transactional access - once the purview of trusted central institutions (development banks, Bretton Woods Institutions, large-scale investment firms, etc.) - is free from the limitations imposed by centralized controls. While a number of old needs now served by these institutions will become obsolete, new blockchain-enabled institutional mechanisms will address a variety of remaining needs more efficiently. New needs will also emerge to be addressed by old, new, and blockchain-refined institutional mechanisms. A continuous iterative process is imperative during such periods of rapid change. Global financial institutions must be responsive to the cultural shift and dynamic societal values accompanying blockchain innovation."
,,,"The hype surrounding the concept of smart cities has been as much a marketing effort to drive the economic development of cities as it has been rooted in the massive transformation finally taking place at the cusp of the convergence of the physical and digital worlds. The smart city as a platform presents an obvious opportunity for growth, but the status of business through the next evolutionary stage of systems change is not certain. This transformation requires diverse strategies and business models that will enable an equitable path forward to accelerate the critically needed convergence of the natural, human and technological systems. This will help create more sustainable cities and slow the global entropy taking place, while at the same time provide a space for a higher quality of life for all citizens. Competition is part of the driving force between nations and cities and must be factored in as part of the equation. New business models incorporating commons-based economics and planetary accounting practices, utilizing technologies including blockchain and holochain across all business channels and formats from P2P to G2G, will secure the potential to develop equitable and sustainable supply chain ecosystems on global and local scales that will further enable convergence. The concept of Flow in the context of smart city operating systems is the ultimate harnessing of collective intelligence and resource optimization, bringing technology to the highest state of realization."
,,,"In the last decade, blockchain has emerged as one of the most influential innovations in software architecture and technology. Ideally, blockchains are designed to be architecturally and politically decentralized, similar to the Internet. In recent times, however, blockchain-based systems have faced stumbling blocks in the form of challenges related to scalability, privacy, security, etc. Several new methods have been proposed both by the research and professional communities to mitigate these challenges. One such recent advancement proposed is the use of sidechains. A sidechain is a secondary blockchain connected to the main blockchain with a two-way peg. Sidechains may have their own consensus protocols, which could be completely different from the mainchain's protocol. Theoretically, a sidechain can add new functionalities, improve privacy, and security of traditionally vanilla blockchains. To this date, however, little is known or discussed regarding factors related to design choices, feasibility, limitations and other issues in adopting the sidechain technology. Moreover, there is a lack of studies discussing how and where it can effectively be integrated into blockchains to remedy current issues in a clear context. Hence, this paper provides the first comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art sidechains and platforms, identifying current advancements and analyzing their impact from various viewpoints, highlighting their limitations and discussing possible remedies for the overall improvement of the blockchain domain."

,,,"Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) has dual aims to reduce emission production and stimulate adoption of long-term abatement technology. Whilst it has generally achieved its first aim, its issues are hindering the accomplishment of the second. Several solutions have been proposed to improve ETSâ€™s efficacy, yet none of them have considered the advancement of Industry 4.0. This paper proposes a novel ETS model customised for Industry 4.0 integration. It incorporates blockchain technology to address ETSâ€™s management and fraud issues whilst it utilizes a reputation system in a new approach to improve ETS efficacy. Specific design of how the blockchain technology and reputation system are used to achieve these objectives is showed within this paper. The case study demonstrates the inner working of reputation-based trading systemâ€”in which reputation signifies participants performance and commitment toward emission reduction effort. Multi-criteria analysis is used to evaluate the proposed scheme against conventional ETS model. The result shows that the proposed model is a feasible scheme and that the benefits of its implementation will outweigh its drawback."

,,,"Recent outbreaks of food contamination scandals in India have resulted in increased concerns amongst consumers about food safety. Further, to tackle such circumstances, conformation to quality has become a must in Agriculture Supply Chain (ASC). Agro-stakeholders have tried to accomplish this demand through the integration of technology in ASC. One such technology is blockchain, which is still in its infancy in terms of adoption in India. Fueled by this motivation, we aim to investigate the significant barriers for blockchain adoption in Indian ASC. The constructs are identified through a comprehensive literature search and opinion of domain experts from five agro-organizations, academia, and agro-stakeholders. Further identified construct is modeled using an integrated ISM-DEMATEL approach, which not only interrogates interrelationship amongst identified constructs but also evaluates the intensity of the relationship between them. The identified constructs are also clustered into a suitable group using Fuzzy-MICMAC. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is also performed to check the robustness of the proposed model. The results reveal that â€œlack of government regulation and lack of trust among agro-stakeholder to use blockchainâ€ are significant adoption barriers of blockchain in Indian ASC. Moreover, the managerial implication about the results is also provided, which will be useful to government and related agencies to take suitable measures to overcome these obstacles for increasing the rate of blockchain adoption in Indian ASC."

,,,"To mitigate our dependence on fossil fuels, new schemes to reward the production and consumption of renewable (green) energy are required. Green energy needs to effectively offset the consumption of grey energy, i.e., energy from mixed sources. The NRGcoin concept supports the integration of renewable energy by incentivizing its local production and consumption within the low-voltage grid. It creates not only a more secure and transparent energy provisioning mechanism, but also promotes a local ecosystem in which key stakeholders (prosumers, consumers, and utilities and grid operators) can mutually benefit from each other. After discussing the main issues with traditional support policies, this chapter presents the NRGcoin concept in details. It describes the problem being solved while emphasizing the main benefits and potential challenges for NRGcoinâ€™s adoption. Finally, we also contribute four important questions, which help set a reasoning framework to clarify and justify the use of Blockchain in addressing various challenges."
,,,"Unstructured data, non-relational databases, distributed databases, and big data analytics potentially change the landscape for digital land data creation, use, management, and dissemination. The way land data is governed and the resultant impact on land tenure security delivery is open to substantial re-thinking. Drawing from international cases, this paper provides a state-of-the-art examination of prototypes and demonstrators from the global land sector. The aim is to deliver an insight into the opportunities, challenges, impacts, and future scenarios regarding the application of the emerging technologies. The paper finds that whilst uptake of non-relational and distributed databases is occurring, it remains largely at the level of proof-of-concept, demonstrator or pilot. Scaled uptake is occurring slower than anticipated, and to a lesser degree than in other sectors. However, the broader and longer-term impacts on the land sector remain difficult to judge. Meanwhile, emerging distributed analytical databases appear to be under-exploited or at least underexplored within the land sector. Overall, the examined technologies are seen to enable new operational approaches for conventional land sector transactions, and also entirely new land related services, digital products, and actors: the ways and means of holding, transferring, and securing land may become more nuanced, fractionalized, and/or automated. Whether these observed embryonic developments lead to sector transformation or orderly transition, is seen to be heavily reliant on the prevailing political, socio-cultural and institutional settings within a jurisdiction."
,,,"Food safety and quality assurance has become increasingly difficult in times of growing global flows of goods. In particular, the traceability of food turns out to be very challenging for retailers, resellers and state surveillance authorities. The reasons for this range from the proof of simple, but harmless modifications to the detection of health-endangering substances, bacteria or viruses. In addition, it concerns the verification of food authenticity, for example the correct declaration of the geographical origin, variety or cultivation. Such quality parameters justify higher prices and therefore, they are often in the focus of food fraudsters. Some of those qualities can be monitored by objective analytical methods, but not all of them. For ensuring the traceability of food trade networks blockchain algorithms incorporate a high potential, as data can be stored in an unmodifiable way and enabling quick tracking across all process steps, so that stakeholders as well as commodities or semi-finished items can be identified much faster. Areas of applications on one hand and limitations on the other hand are discussed in this review article and reflected with alternative strategies."

The pattern of IoT is flooring the way for the world where maximum number of devices that are interconnected and they collect information from the environment and then automate certain tasks. While dealing with smart devices, some factors such as data privacy, data security, authentication, strength against attacks, valid authorization, self-maintenance, and easy operation are needed to be considered. Features like these can be easily brought into the picture using blockchain technology which was born with the crypto currency called Bitcoin, created by an anonymous group named Satoshi Nakamoto. This chapter will cover the basics of IoT and blockchain and how to adopt blockchain specifically for IoT so that one can have a well-developed blockchain-based IoT (BIoT) system that can be effectively and efficiently be used, such devices are named as BIoT devices and they come under BIoT applications. One of the continuous encounters faced by us in IoTâ€™s triumph is about how to protect and privatize the transactions on the devices each time. It will be rigid to refer a technology that will benefit and will have impactful effect on human life than the IoT and also there is no better technology than blockchain for authenticated and authorized transactions that forms a distributed ledger. This chapter will evaluate how blockchain helps in strengthening the security in the IoT.

While some research has looked into the implications of BCT for tourism management and marketing, no studies have explicitly considered the scope of its application in the context of hospitality operations management. This is arguably a major omission as available evidence points at the foremost potential of BCT to affect the nature of hospitality business. This study partially plugs this knowledge gap and, by reviewing examples of existing applications of BCT in various economic sectors and across different consumption markets, evaluates its potential for future integration into hospitality operations management. The framework of prospective use of BCT in the hospitality industry alongside the related organisational, institutional and technological challenges that need to be overcome for its wider industrial adoption are outlined."

However, issues such as vaccine expiration and vaccine record fraud are still widespread in vaccine supply chains. Therefore, an effective management system for the supervision of vaccine supply chains is urgently required. As the next generation of core technology after the Internet, blockchain is designed to build trust mechanisms that can change current information management methods. Meanwhile, the development of machine learning technologies provides additional ways to analyze the data in information management systems. The main objective of this study is to develop a â€œvaccine blockchainâ€ system based on blockchain and machine learning technologies. This vaccine blockchain system is designed to support vaccine traceability and smart contract functions, and can be used to address the problems of vaccine expiration and vaccine record fraud. Additionally, the use of machine learning models can provide valuable recommendations to immunization practitioners and recipients, allowing them to choose better immunization methods and vaccines."
,,,"This paper evaluates blockchain's roles in strengthening cybersecurity and protecting privacy. Since most of the data is currently stored in cloud data centers, it also compares how blockchain performs vis-vis the cloud in various aspects of security and privacy. Key underlying mechanisms related to the blockchain's impacts on the Internet of Things (IoT) security are also covered. From the security and privacy considerations, it highlights how blockchain-based solutions could possibly be, in many aspects, superior to the current IoT ecosystem, which mainly relies on centralized cloud servers through service providers. Using practical applications and real-world examples, the paper argues that blockchain's decentralized feature is likely to result in a low susceptibility to manipulation and forgery by malicious participants. Special consideration is also given to how blockchain-based identity and access management systems can address some of the key challenges associated with IoT security. The paper provides a detailed analysis and description of blockchain's roles in tracking the sources of insecurity in supply chains related to IoT devices. The paper also delves into how blockchain can make it possible to contain an IoT security breach in a targeted way after it is discovered. It discusses and evaluates initiatives of organizations, inter-organizational networks and industries on this front. A number of policy implications are discussed. First, in order to strengthen IoT, regulators can make it obligatory for firms to deploy blockchain in supply chain, especially in systems that are mission critical, and have substantial national security and economic benefits. Second, public policy efforts directed at protecting privacy using blockchain should focus on providing training to key stakeholders and increasing investment in this technology. Third, one way to enrich the blockchain ecosystem would be to turn attention to publicâ€“private partnerships. Finally, national governments should provide legal clarity and more information for parties to engage in smart contracts that are enforceable."
,,,"Social and environmental audits (SEA) in supply chains prove to be difficult: costly, administratively challenging, retrospective and often lacking veracity and timeliness. The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of technology (such as blockchain, satellite imaging and others) in improving the veracity and timeliness of SEA in supply chains. We develop conceptualizations of veracity and timeliness appropriate to the SEA context. We also link veracity and timeliness to key steps in the auditing process (data collection, recording and sharing, and analysis and interpretation) and explore technologyâ€™s role in these steps. We then contrast the traditional audit process to a technology-enhanced audit process and develop an organizing framework to generate a research agenda linking technology-enhanced auditing to veracity and timeliness of the audit process, and, in turn, enhancing social and environmental supply chain performance. The novelty and value of our work lie in its exploration of how technology-enhanced auditing relates to (1) issues related to scope/focus, firm motivations for SEA, and governance of the audit function, (2) three conditions under which the benefits of technology-enhanced audits are most likely, (3) the 4Â Vâ€™s of data (volume, variety, velocity/timeliness and veracity); and (4) possible mechanisms by which veracity and timeliness affect social and environmental performance in the supply chain."
,,,"The economic development of rural India requires connecting remote villages to local and global supply chains. Yet, high rates of financial exclusion inhibit rural Indians from participating in these supply networks. We review the literature on financial inclusion, adoption, and blockchain in India, and posit that to resolve financial exclusion, the four challenges of geographical access, high cost, inappropriate banking products, and financial illiteracy need to be overcome. Next, we argue that blockchain technologies hold the potential to overcome most of these challenges. However, for blockchain technologies to become the cornerstone of financial inclusion initiatives, an understanding of technology adoption in India is needed. To guide the development of such understanding, we develop a research agenda on the antecedents of adoption, adoption patterns, and outcomes of adoption. Answering these research questions will lead to a nuanced understanding of adoption of blockchain-based technologies in rural India. The practical contribution of this paper is the discussion of how blockchain can alleviate the issue of financial exclusion in rural India, thereby providing a basis for a solution that could connect rural Indians to global supply chain networks. The theoretical contribution lies in the identification of knowledge gaps that should be answered to achieve financial inclusion of rural Indians."
,,,"The use of the â€œBlockchainâ€ technological architecture is growing worldwide, given its structural characteristics aimed at security and information integrity, without the need for a central guarantor. Although Blockchain has become known for its support of crypto-coins (or crypto currencies), especially Bitcoin, its scope has become much larger, including businesses of relevant social impact. This paper presents an application of the Ethereumâ€™s Blockchain digital architecture for the solid waste management in a small municipality in the State of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. This application comes to replace a paper-based current system. The current system uses printed cards called Green Coins, presenting vulnerabilities that should be overcome with the implementation of the new system. The blockchain-based system provides financial management for the collection of waste in the municipality aiming at better health and socio-environmental education and the financial and social inclusion of volunteer citizens, through the use of social currency. The proposed application uses social crypto-coins and security support through Ethereumâ€™s Blockchain, instead of the printed cards currently being used, including volunteer citizens, store owners and public agents. It should contribute in a relevant way to improving the quality of life in the municipality in relation to the typical aspects of sustainability: education, health, environment, social inclusion and local economy, contributing to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The proposed application may eventually expand in to other municipalities, including major urban centers and private condominiums."
,,,"The blockchain has had to grow up rather quickly as financial firms, consultants, healthcare providers, and others have all sought ways to implement the technology into their stack. However, for many, the blockchain is still a nebulous concept. And even if they understand the â€œwhatâ€, understanding why it should be used and what problems it can solve remains unclear. This chapter answers these questions and more. What is a blockchain? How does it work? How does a blockchain handle trust in a distributed fashion? And when should a blockchain actually be used for a project? Ultimately, there are nine factors that comprise a blockchain that include: shifting trust from a middleman to the system; cryptography & public-key infrastructure; an immutable nature so the ledger can be completely trusted; and decentralization, so even if one node goes down, the data remains secure. Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize many industries and use cases, and we've only touched on the tip of this iceberg. The information in this chapter will provide the necessary introduction to guide you on your path to using the blockchain."
,,,"In this chapter, we provide a smorgasbord of emergent technologies on the watch. We begin with an introduction to telehomecare; continue our discussions on the topic of the use of robots for medical and healthcare applications, artificial intelligence and its usage in health and medical care, and virtual reality and its applications in healthcare and medicine; and conclude with blockchain technology. We discuss these technologies with a view to their present and future potential."
,,,"In this chapter the use of decentralized blockchain mechanisms is examined for delivering transparent, secure, reliable, and timely energy flexibility, under the form of adaptation of energy demand profiles of professional consumer of distributed energy resources, to all the stakeholders involved in the flexibility markets. In this technique the power presumption data are manipulated by a blockchain-based distributed ledger records. The data gather intelligent metering equipment from the Internet of Things, while self-enforcing smart contracts identify programmatically the anticipated energy flexibility at the level of each prosumer, the related benefits or penalties, and the regulations for balancing energy demand with grid-level energy production. Consensus-based validation will be used to validate demand response programs and to enable the flexibility providersâ€™ suitable economic settlement. The method was validated using a prototype of several structures from literature information sets. The results demonstrate that the blockchain-based distributed demand-side management is capable to match energy demand and generation at smart grid level, the demand response indicator being tracked with high precision, while the amount of energy flexibility needed for merging is decreased."
,,,"This study proposes a comprehensive user acceptance model for Bitcoin transaction services, while also statistically presenting how four user-oriented theories (innovation diffusion theory, the benefit-risk concept, the theory of planned behavior, and transaction cost theory) contribute to the understanding of user intent regarding the use of these services. Results from more than 1300 samples suggest that both perceived benefits and service compatibility play notable roles in determining behavioral intent, while perceived risk, cost, and complexity were found to have no significant impact on user adoption. Moreover, both the potential trialability and observability of the services were investigated as weak antecedents of user adoption. On the basis of these results, the resulting managerial and theoretical implications are examined, albeit with notable limitations."
,,,"To maintain grid stability in terms of frequency and voltage with a high penetration of intermittent solar and wind power generation, machine to machine matching of the power supply and demand will be the key solution. The new concept of â€œDigital Gridâ€ is introduced and developed. Digital Grid is the Blockchain based electricity market with the software-defined multiple inverters (Digital Grid Router) and AI edge computers (Digital Grid Controller). The Digital Grid can accept high penetrations of renewable power, prevent cascading outages, accommodate identifiable tagged electricity flows, track those transactions, and trade electricity and environmental value as identified unique products."
,,,"The rapid growth in information technology and related talent has let to a competition among the investors to look for the best available talent. Additionally, the diverse range of directions in technology, gives a lot of options to the applicants to choose from. In such a scenario, it is imperative to link the most appropriate investors and developers in a secure and cost optimal way. Blockchain technology helps in creating a decentralized network of users where the transactions are recorded in an open distributed ledger. These features of blockchain enable a transparent and cost-effective platform for different applications. Based on the need to an effective crowdfunding platform for developing smart nation and the inherent features of blockchain technology, we propose a global crowdfunding platform called BitFund. Investors and developers can act as different nodes of the network. The investors can request a specific project and they can give their initial bid value in terms of time, cost and maintenance required. Different developers can bid with different values of the same parameters to get the project ownership. A smart contract is deployed between the investors and the developers to reach an optimal solution for the investors. Multiple iterations of bidding are carried out between the developers until the optimal solution or equilibrium is reached. The experimental results show that the proposed model yields better results as compared to other generic algorithms for crowdfunding."
,,,"The concept of Supply Chain Management (SCM) is very imperative while moving sensitive products from one entity to the next entity until it reaches to the end-users to avoid damage(s) in the product. In the traditional supply chain management system, several serious problems such as tampering of products, delay, and fraud, etc. exist. It also lacks proper authentication among the participants, data management as well as the integrity of the data. The blockchain mechanism is capable of solving the above-mentioned issues due to its important features such as decentralization, transparency, trust-less environment, anonymity, and immutability. This paper describes how the blockchain mechanism combines with the traditional pharmaceutical supply chain system and to achieve a better SCM system, we present a blockchain-based scheme for information sharing securely in the pharmaceutical supply chain system with smart contracts and consensus mechanism. The proposed scheme also provides a mechanism to distribute required cryptographic keys to all the participants securely using the smart contract technique. Further, transaction and block validation protocols have been designed in our protocol. The security analysis ensures that our protocol is robust and also achieves reasonable performance in terms of computation and communication overheads."
,,,"The ongoing, in-depth transformation of the electricity sector towards increased use of alternative, renewable energy sources extends beyond a simple decentralisation drive in the electricity market. The transformation process is characterised by the interplay of old and new technologies from the energy sector as well as structural coupling with other sectors, such as the information and communications technology (ICT), enabling the technology transfer as well as market entry by information technology (IT) actors. Blockchain-based technologies have the potential to play a key role in this transition by offering decentralised interfaces and systems as well as an alternative approach to the current organisation form of the energy market. This paper discusses the applicability and prospects for blockchain-based technologies in the energy sector, which are described using the term â€œblockchain energyâ€. For the purposes of this study, blockchain energy encompasses all socio-technical and organisational configurations in the energy sector based on the utilisation of the blockchain principle for energy trading, information storage, and/or increased transparency of energy flows and energy services. In the following chapters, the authors present and discuss the current transformation in the electricity market, followed by a review of the different utilisation possibilities for blockchain technologies in the energy sector and a discussion of the barriers and potential for blockchain energy using a transition studies perspective. Finally, the opportunities and risks of blockchain energy are discussed."
,,,"In platform operations for rental services, product information disclosure (supported by the blockchain technology) is critical to attract customers. We build a stylized duopoly model to analyze the product-information-disclosure Nash game between two rental service platforms whose products-to-rent are substituble. We derive the equilibrium level of product information disclosure and identify conditions under which the platforms choose to disclose or not to disclose information, which correspond to different types of supply chains. For the basic model, we find that there exists a critical threshold on the information-sensitive consumers which helps each platform decide whether or not to disclose product information. If the information auditing cost is sufficiently small, both platforms should disclose the product information as much as possible. For products with higher profit margin, both platforms are more likely to disclose information. We also explore the impacts of product information disclosure on the consumer surplus and seller benefits, and discuss the roles played by the blockchain technology. To check robustness of the results as well as to examine different supply chain configurations, we extend the analysis to the cases including (i) the platforms are risk averse in decision making, (ii) rather than selling the product, the seller (owner of the product) consigns the product to the platform and shares a revenue, and (iii) rather than two competing platforms, there is a common rental service platform providing service for two substitutable products. We find that the core insights remain valid in all the extended models. Managerial implications are discussed."
,,,"This study explores a mixed model for the factors promoting the use of cryptocurrencies. This research has conducted by theoretical saturation, exploratory factor analysis and the Fridman test. According to the findings, thirty-one factors affect cryptocurrency usage. The results revealed that the central banks in developing countries, commercial banks, financial institutions, financial and business managers, public policymakers, and even the general public can capitalize on these factors. This study also explored a model developed based on the EFA that confirmed the positive effect of three factors on the level of cryptocurrency usage, namely the technological skills, technological ambiguity, and technological advantages. For the first time, the present study models the consumption factors of cryptocurrencies and ranks them from the consumersâ€™ perspective."
,,,"In emerging markets, there are data quality problems. In this paper, we establish theoretical models to explore how data quality problems affect sustainable fashion supply chain operations. We start with the decentralized supply chain and find that poor data quality lowers supply chain profit and social welfare. We consider the implementation of blockchain to help and identify the situation in which blockchain helps enhance social welfare but brings harm to supply chain profitability. We propose a government sponsor scheme as well as an environment taxation waiving scheme to help. We further extend the study to the centralized supply chain setting."
,,,"Cyberâ€“physical systems combine physical objects or systems with integrated computational facilities and data storage. From that perspective, Smart Grids are a mixture of physical actuators, sensors, physical communication networks; and cyber computational and communication protocols and algorithms. In our work, we propose to extend the applicability of decentralized blockchain consensus protocols to the broad field of Cyberâ€“Physical systems. Our contribution includes a proposal of a new family of cyberâ€“physical systems, an in-depth discussion of new possibilities and inherent shortcomings. The proposed coupling of the data storage mechanisms, communication and consensus protocols, allows for deployment of self-sustaining cyberâ€“physical environments in which all the mission-critical aspects in both the cyber and physical layer are effectively incentivized, coordinated and maintained. This includes the essential data storage, data exchange, but also the production, transmission and distribution of energy. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first such a comprehensive undertaking toward symbiotic cyberâ€“physical systems and environments. The proposed family of systems is decentralized and does not imply the necessity of reliance on trusted third parties. We propose and discuss an architecture which incorporates physical, blockchain-enabled sensors and actuators capable of monitoring and altering parameters of the underlying physical layer. We analyze a particular instance of a blockchain-aided CPSâ€™, where we are concerned with the power grid at both the micro and macro-grid level. At the macro-grid level we explore the possibility of utilizing blockchain-enabled physical actuators. These theoretical actuators are able to introduce savings by a near real-time routing of energy and enable for tracking of power losses thanks to decentralized accountability. At the micro-grid level we propose a network of blockchain-enabled smart meters to coordinate real-time auction-based energy trade. To glue together the elements of such an open, trustless, decentralized system, we discuss an intrinsic communication protocol capable of rewarding intermediaries of a data exchange for each transmitted byte. We tackle the feasibility, security and accountability challenges which we have faced and which will need to be considered by future architects of the new, exciting family of cyberâ€“physical systems."
,,,"Todayâ€™s globalized and highly competitive world market has broadened the spectrum of requirements in all the sectors of the agri-food industry. This paper focuses on the dairy industry, on its need to adapt to the current market by becoming more resource efficient, environment-friendly, transparent and secure. The Internet of Things (IoT), Edge Computing (EC) and Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) are all crucial to the achievement of those improvements because they allow to digitize all parts of the value chain, providing detailed information to the consumer on the final product and ensuring its safety and quality. In Smart Farming environments, IoT and DLT enable resource monitoring and traceability in the value chain, allowing producers to optimize processes, provide the origin of the produce and guarantee its quality to consumers. In comparison to a centralized cloud, EC manages the Big Data generated by IoT devices by processing them at the network edge, allowing for the implementation of services with shorter response times, and a higher Quality of Service (QoS) and security. This work presents a platform oriented to the application of IoT, Edge Computing, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain techniques in Smart Farming environments, by means of the novel Global Edge Computing Architecture, and designed to monitor the state of dairy cattle and feed grain in real time, as well as ensure the traceability and sustainability of the different processes involved in production. The platform is deployed and tested in a real scenario on a dairy farm, demonstrating that the implementation of EC contributes to a reduction in data traffic and an improvement in the reliability in communications between the IoT-Edge layers and the Cloud."
,,,"The logistics and supply chain management (SCM) field is experimenting with the integration of blockchain, a cutting-edge, and highly disruptive technology. Yet, blockchain is still nascent, and the extant literature on this technology is scarce, especially as regards the relationship between blockchain and SCM. Additionally, existing studies have not yet addressed sufficiently the enablers of blockchain adoption and the interplay with supply chain performance. In order to reduce this gap, this study aims to examine the potential influence of blockchain on supply chain performance. We draw on the literature on technology adoption and supply chain performance, as well as on the emerging blockchain literature, to develop and test a model in two countries, namely India and the US. Accordingly, we administered a survey in order to review the opinions and views of supply chain practitioners. The results support the model and indicate that blockchain applications can improve supply chain performance. In particular, our findings suggest that knowledge sharing and trading partner pressure play an important role in blockchain adoption, and that supply chain performance is significantly influenced by supply chain transparency and blockchain transparency. Another finding was the inexistence of evidence for a moderation effect of the industry variable on the outcomes. The research conclusions have substantial managerial and theoretical implications. Our model contributes mainly to the theoretical advancement of SCM-blockchain, thus allowing scholars to adapt our validated model."
,,,"Blockchain technology has gained global attention with potential to revolutionize supply chain management and sustainability achievements. The few applied ongoing use cases include blockchain for food, healthcare, and logistics supply chains have emphasized blockchain's untapped potential. Potential support supply chain and sustainability issues include improving efficiency, transparency, and traceability in addition to billions of dollars in corporate financial savings. Given its promise, the adoption of blockchain technology, although hyped for years, has not seen rapid acceptance. In this study, the technology-organization-environment framework and force field theories are utilized to investigate blockchain adoption barriers. Using various literature streams on technology, organizational practices, and sustainability, a comprehensive overview of barriers for adopting blockchain technology to manage sustainable supply chains is provided. The barriers are explored using technology, organizational, and environmental â€“ supply chain and external â€“ framework followed by inputs from academics and industry experts and then analyzed using the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) tool. The results show that supply chain and technological barriers are the most critical barriers among both academics and industry experts. We further determine the similarities and differences among academics and practitioners in perceiving the barriers. This exploratory study reveals interesting relative importance and interrelationships of barriers which are necessary, theoretically and practically for further adoption and dissemination of blockchain technology in a sustainable supply chain environment. It also sets the stage for theoretical observations for understanding blockchain technology implementation in sustainable supply chains. A series of research propositions and research directions culminate from this exploratory study."
,,,"The circular economy offers a way for businesses to conceptualize sustainable economic activity with a concern for environmental and societal well-being. Putting this concept into practice is a complex undertaking, given the current production and consumption systems, and necessitates strategies that enable competition and cooperation between various actors to generate and scale up the best ideas. Simultaneous competition and cooperation, or coopetition, is studied in strategy literature within the context of managing the complexity of business networks. Coopetition could offer valuable perspectives for firms transitioning to circular models. The purpose of this paper is to show how coopetition could be operationalized and optimized using tokens in a blockchain to support a transition to circular models of value creation and appropriation. The findings of our study indicate that tokens could enable previously disconnected product ecosystems to converge and unleash the waves of creativity and innovation required for circular business models. However, facilitating such convergence would require the coopetition models to transition from comprising the current stages of value creation and appropriation to being based on value creation and circulation."
,,,"Transformation of agribusiness is critical in light of the Agenda for Sustainable Development. FinTech and the integration of FinTech with other (green) technologies as well as with digitized agriculture plays an important role when it comes to, for example, SDG 12, specifically, responsible production, as it can mitigate trade-offs and enhance synergies between environmental and social SDGs, for example, 1 and 15, increasing profitability without additional use of natural resources. Important limitations and risks need to be addressed, however, for developing countries to fully benefit from the potential that FinTech holds in this context. Mitigating factors include massive infrastructure investments and large-scale capacity building. Rigorous research on economic sustainability and cost-effectiveness of newer FinTech models is needed to make sound policy recommendations."
,,,"The lack of industrialization, inadequacy of the management, information inaccuracy, and inefficient supply chains are the significant issues in an agri-food supply chain. The proposed solutions to overcome these challenges should not only consider the way the food is produced but also take care of societal, environmental and economic concerns. There has been increasing use of emerging technologies in the agriculture supply chains. The internet of things, the blockchain, and big data technologies are potential enablers of sustainable agriculture supply chains. These technologies are driving the agricultural supply chain towards a digital supply chain environment that is data-driven. Realizing the significance of a data-driven sustainable agriculture supply chain we extracted and reviewed 84 academic journals from 2000 to 2017. The primary purpose of the review was to understand the level of analytics used (descriptive, predictive and prescriptive), sustainable agriculture supply chain objectives attained (social, environmental and economic), the supply chain processes from where the data is collected, and the supply chain resources deployed for the same. Based on the results of the review, we propose an application framework for the practitioners involved in the agri-food supply chain that identifies the supply chain visibility and supply chain resources as the main driving force for developing data analytics capability and achieving the sustainable performance. The framework will guide the practitioners to plan their investments to build a robust data-driven agri-food supply chain. Finally, we outline the future research directions and limitations of our study."
,,,"In the postwar era, the Syrian Civil War has become the bloodiest, prolonged, and protracted conflict in the 21st century. It inherently includes various dimensions, increasing complexity in the pattern, both in the defense sector and in the ensuing displacement-cum-migration crises, on a scale that the world has hitherto witnessed. This has pretty much caused a huge (direct and/or indirect) paradigm shift in the socioeconomic and political patterns and processes around the World. Although the political crisis has induced large-scale migration, including mass exodus, which many have described as the â€œThe Great Humanitarian Crisis,â€ the defense sector is slowly imbibing various technologies including artificial intelligence and digitalization into it. The Syrian Civil War has resulted in the loss of nearly half a million Syrian lives, injuring over 1 million injured and many millions who are either internally displaced persons (IDPs) or have become refugees, besides degrading societal conditions and instability. An estimated 5.6 million Syrians have been forced to become refugees, around 6.2 million accounts for IDPs. Globally, almost one-sixth of the world population are without provable identity, while 20 trillion USD of unowned capital lay around. A prominent issue in resolving The Great Humanitarian Crisis is to legitimately identify the refugees and IDPs. But a large number of the refugees and IDPs lack evidence or verification documents like identity cards, property deeds, passports; most of which would have been lost while fleeing for their lives, amidst conflicts or bombardments. This creates a number of hindrances for their return, reentry, identity verification, validation, certification and rehabilitation, repatriation, and resettlement as well. This also leads to issues of increasing illegal entry points, lack of property restitution and/or compensation, along with the lack of livelihood opportunities or overdependence on aid. Moreover, issues like trust deficit, leakages in distribution, and accessibility to goods and services exacerbate the situation. A number of actors have taken initiatives to record, authenticate, and verify identities but the documentation processes and mechanisms have often been found practically lacking. This issue could be dealt with by providing verifiable universal identity (a global passport) to the population, particularly the refugees and IDPs. Blockchain Technology-Based System (BTBS) has been increasingly used by various actors to identify, provide support, funding, aid, and food to refugees and IDPs. At the same time, the disruptive nature of BTBS as a foundational technology into the defense sector has also been dealt with. Interestingly, the pros and cons of the system have been one that is debatable. In this context, the chapter seeks to discuss the features, deployment, technical innovations, ethical considerations, and issues related to the global use and implementation of BTBS."
,,,"Understanding the potential blockchain has to offer the world of climate finance, is essential in achieving the goals set out by the Paris Climate Agreement. Based on conversation with masterminds in the field, this chapter aims to demystify the innovative new technology and explore the areas in which blockchainâ€™s application could make a crucial difference in the pursuit of climate pledges. These range from its potential in helping to upscale private climate investment to the vital role which it could play in facilitating peer-to-peer energy transactions. The experts interviewed in this chapter are Sven Braden, a climate change negotiator with over a decade of experience in representing the nation of Liechtenstein, and Stefan Klauser, a FinTech expert with an extensive background in blockchain innovation as a lead organizer at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH Zurich)."
,,,"Blockchain Technology (BT) has led to a disruption in the supply chain by removing the trust related issues. Studies are being conducted worldwide to leverage the benefits provided by BT in improving the performance of the supply chains. The literature reveals BT to offer various benefits leading to improvements in the sustainable performance of the agriculture supply chains (ASC). It is expected that BT will bring a paradigm shift in the way the transactions are carried in the ASC by reducing the high number of intermediaries, delayed payments and high transaction lead times. India, a developing economy, caters to the food security needs of an ever-growing population and faces many challenges affecting ASC sustainability. It is therefore essential to adopt BT in the ASC to leverage the various benefits. In this study, we identify and establish the relationships between the enablers of BT adoption in ASC. Thirteen enablers were identified from the literature and validated by the experts before applying a combined Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) and Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) methodology to envision the complex causal relationships between the identified BT enablers. The findings from the study suggest that, among the identified enablers, traceability was the most significant reason for BT implementation in ASC followed by auditability, immutability, and provenance. The findings of the study will help the practitioners to design the strategies for BT implementation in agriculture, creating a real-time data-driven ASC. The results will also help the policymakers in developing policies for faster implementation of BT ensuring food safety and sustainable ASCs."
,,,"Blockchain technologies and business models offer a multitude of decentralized and distributed services, but our understanding of the conditions necessary to reach the emerging technologyâ€™s full potential is incomplete. The benefits are perhaps most pronounced in developing economies where high institutional misalignment, or even dysfunction, leaves much room for improvement, but we know even less about these contexts due to a dearth of primary research. In this article, we survey thirteen key entrepreneurs and managers in Kenya to identify and observe the current challenges associated with unlocking the potential of blockchain-enabled services. We identify three conditions that need to be met: sufficient technical capacity, appropriate regulative interventions, and most importantly, the adoption of decentralization logics. To truly leverage blockchain technology, market and institutional actors need to collaborate to overcome the paradox of centrally legitimate, decentralized solutions."
,,,"Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), such as blockchain, has the potential to transform supply chains. It can provide a cryptographically secure and immutable record of transactions and associated metadata (origin, contracts, process steps, environmental variations, microbial records, etc.) linked across whole supply chains. The ability to trace food items within and along a supply chain is legally required by all actors within the chain. It is critical to food safety, underpins trust and global food trade. However, current food traceability systems are not linked between all actors within the supply chain. Key metadata on the age and process history of a food is rarely transferred when a product is bought and sold through multiple steps within the chain. Herein, we examine the potential of massively scalable DLT to securely link the entire food supply chain, from producer to end user. Under such a paradigm, should a food safety or quality issue ever arise, authorized end users could instantly and accurately trace the origin and history of any particular food item. This novel and unparalleled technology could help underpin trust for the safety of all food, a critical component of global food security. In this paper, we investigate the (i) data requirements to develop DLT technology across whole supply chains, (ii) key challenges and barriers to optimizing the complete system, and (iii) potential impacts on production efficiency, legal compliance, access to global food markets and the safety of food. Our conclusion is that while DLT has the potential to transform food systems, this can only be fully realized through the global development and agreement on suitable data standards and governance. In addition, key technical issues need to be resolved including challenges with DLT scalability, privacy and data architectures."
,,,"Blockchain is the latest â€˜disruptive innovationâ€™ that has caught scholarsâ€™ attention. It is the underlying technology for Bitcoin and other digital currencies. Stakeholders like developers, entrepreneurs, and technology enthusiasts claim blockchain has the potential to reconfigure the contemporary economic, legal, political and cultural landscape. Skeptics claim the concept and its applications remain ambiguous and uncertain. Business scholars began publishing studies on the emergence and impact of blockchain, bitcoin, and related projects in 2014. In this study, we conduct a PRISMA guided systematic review of blockchain research in the business literature from 2014 to 2018. Our results show a rapid increase of studies over the five year period. The findings also convey key insights about the current state of scholarly investigation on blockchain, including its top benefits and challenges for business and society. We found that blockchain remains an early-stage domain of research in terms of theoretical grounding, methodological diversity, and empirically grounded work. We suggest research directions to improve our understanding of the state of blockchain and advance future research of this increasingly important and expansive area."
,,,"The digitalization phenomenon is leveraging new relationship models through the entire supply chain network. In this outlook, blockchain is a cutting-edge technology that is already transforming and remodeling the relationships between all members of logistics and supply chain systems. Yet, while studies on blockchain have gained a relative pace over the recent years, the literature on this topic does not report sufficient research cases on blockchain adoption behavior at the individual level. The present study, therefore, aims to bridge this gap, notably by helping understand the individual blockchain adoption behavior in the logistics and supply chain field in India and the USA. Drawing on the emerging literature on blockchain, supply chain and network theory, as well as on technology acceptance models (TAMs), we have developed a model based on a slightly-altered version of the classical unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). The model being developed was then estimated using the Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). As the model was eventually supported, the results obtained revealed the existence of distinct adoption behaviors between India-based and USA-based professionals. In parallel, the findings appear as a useful contribution to and a sign of progress for the literature on IT adoption, SCM, and blockchain."
,,,"The recent attention to the situatedness and spatiality of finance has consequences for understanding financial risks. The focus on geofinance and financial ecologyrequires investigation in risk interdependences at all levels (individual, institutional, and systemic) and across different countries and cultures. Financial risks relate to financial intermediation, execution of payments, financial protection, supply of financial products, and smooth functioning of money. Perception and management of these risks can be distorted by behavioral biases, institutional risk cultures, and interconnectedness within global financial networks. Modern financial technologies such as FinTech, RegTech, blockchain, and digital currencies pose new challenges for risk management."
,,,"Blockchain technology has been ushering in nothing short of a decentralized revolution. Distributed/decentralized energy is recognized the best way to ensure energy sustainability in the future. An open question is what promise the integration of blockchain and energy hold for energy future. This paper systematically reviews the theory of blockchain and explores the current status of energy blockchain research and applications using a visual bibliometric analysis method and the Scopus database from 2014 to 2020. The results show that the number of publications about blockchain technology in the energy sector have been skyrocketing, especially since 2018, which indicates the combining blockchain technology with energy sector is a new cross-cutting research area with increasing attention. At the national level, developing countries begin to move to the world stage, catching up or even surpassing several traditional developed countries in the field of energy blockchain. Cluster analysis results show that the existing energy blockchain research focuses on renewable energy, trying to solve the bottlenecks in its development process, and providing better solutions for the replacement of fossil energy by renewable energy. We therefore contend that blockchain may be fueling the renewable energy and powering our energy sustainability. Finally, the possible future development trend of energy blockchain is offered."
,,,"In this commentary, we explore how blockchain is being leveraged to address the fundamental problems with market-based forest protection globally. In doing so, we consider the ways â€˜cryptocarbonâ€™ initiatives are creating new challenges that have so far escaped critical scrutiny. A blockchain is a distributed and immutable electronic database â€“ a ledger of every transaction that has ever taken place on a network, stored as cryptographically secured blocks, strung together in a chain. The technology is being increasingly hyped as applicable for a whole range of industries, social service provisions, and environmental management concerns. This includes the facilitation of natural asset market mechanisms, like Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). The original aim of REDD+ was to incentivise conservation, making tropical forests more valuable standing than cut down. Multiple factors, including lack of consumer interest, created an oversupply of carbon commodities. Ninety-five percent of the worldâ€™s avoided deforestation credits, representing millions of hectares of conserved forest, were stuck without a buyer. Several flagging REDD+ projects are now hoping that blockchain technology can carry them to new heights of market capitalisation. However, like with any powerful new technology, the benefits remain ambiguous."
,,,"Recently, the concept of â€œSmart Citiesâ€ has developed considerably with the rise and development of the Internet of Things as new form of sustainable development. Smart cities are based on autonomous and distributed infrastructure that includes intelligent information processing and control systems heterogeneous network infrastructure, and ubiquitous sensing involving millions of information sources Due to the continued growth of data volume and number of connected IoT devices, however, issues such as high latency, bandwidth bottlenecks, security and privacy, and scalability arise in the current smart city network architecture. Designing an efficient, secure, and scalable distributed architecture by bringing computational and storage resources closer to endpoints is needed to address the limitations of todayâ€™s smart city network. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid network architecture for the smart city by leveraging the strength of emerging Software Defined Networking and blockchain technologies. To achieve efficiency and address the current limitations, our architecture is divided into two parts: core network and edge network. Through the design of a hybrid architecture, our proposed architecture inherits the strength of both centralized and distributed network architectures. We also propose a Proof-of-Work scheme in our model to ensure security and privacy. To evaluate the feasibility and performance of our proposed model, we simulate our model and evaluate it based on various performance metrics. The result of the evaluation shows the effectiveness of our proposed model."
,,,"Blockchain technology has gained considerable attention for different types of stakeholders due to its stable implementation in the field of digital currency like Bitcoin. Some users use Bitcoin for payment exchanges against any business while others use the Bitcoin network for earning Bitcoins itself, and there is also another type of user who called hackers those flood different types of attacks to illegally earn some Bitcoins or collapsing overall network. There are also numerous uses of blockchain technology, e.g. health, automation industry, energy sector, security and authentication in smart grids. In this study, we have elaborated on different critical aspects of Blockchain technology like its style of working mechanism, possible improvement suggestions by using Proof-of-Stake, and other custom variations, attempting seven types of challenges by different novel techniques. Moreover, we have also explained the current state-of-the-artwork in blockchainâ€™s non-financial applications like Healthcare in which contribution of four-layered custom blockchain models related to precision medicine and the clinical trial was notable. Moreover, a mobile app model called HDG for the automation of medical records without compromising privacy was also a prominent contribution."
,,,"Blockchain is an emerging digital technology allowing ubiquitous financial transactions among distributed untrusted parties, without the need of intermediaries such as banks. This article examines the impact of blockchain technology in agriculture and food supply chain, presents existing ongoing projects and initiatives, and discusses overall implications, challenges and potential, with a critical view over the maturity of these projects. Our findings indicate that blockchain is a promising technology towards a transparent supply chain of food, with many ongoing initiatives in various food products and food-related issues, but many barriers and challenges still exist, which hinder its wider popularity among farmers and systems. These challenges involve technical aspects, education, policies and regulatory frameworks."
,,,"The problem of social costs, negative externalities and collateral damage (especially related to environmental issues) has remained in the focus of economics for over a century. These issues have become critically important for economic governance in the context of climate change. Ronald Coase has proposed the most efficient market-based approach to the problem of social costs. This approach has introduced the concept of limited right to perform activities harmful to the third party and provided basis for a peer-to-peer (P2P) settlement of reciprocal damage. Decentralized P2P approach is necessary for evaluation of negative impact costs and mitigation benefits. Advance of decentralized arbitration technologies, such as Blockchain, crucially decreases transaction costs for P2P interactions and thus provides for further development of Coase paradigm. Application of Blockchain technology to mitigat collateral socio-environmental damage of economic activities relies on a concept of decentralized P2P and public evaluation of negative impact, distribution of liability, and settlement in the form of mitigation. Decentralized autonomous organization integral platform for climate initiatives (DAO IPCI) is designed to be truly decentralized public Blockchain-ecosystem and aims at creation of common business space to attract financing from investors not limited by financial capacity, location, or legal status with minimization of transaction costs, increased reliability and transparency of the whole process, which would be free of interference, interventions, manipulations, or falsifications. Although the initial objective is to provide existing markets with a â€œBlockchain optionâ€ or â€œBlockchain representation,â€ the goal is also to create a way for environmental markets to evolve toward truly decentralized and free personal market choice model."
,,,"In a global marketplace, customers are often unaware of the exact sources of the products they purchase and consume. To address this lack of awareness, blockchain technology can be implemented in supply chains to increase customersâ€™ knowledge of productsâ€™ provenance. Provenance knowledgeâ€”information about productsâ€™ origin, production, modifications, and custodyâ€”enables customers to be assured of their purchasing decisions. This assurance comes from information on the origin, authenticity, custody, and integrity of the product that helps reduce risk perceptions. We develop a provenance knowledge framework and show how its application can enhance assurances and reduce perceived risks via the application of blockchain. We present a guide on how to implement blockchain to establish provenance knowledge and close with a kind warning on the importance of demonstrating the value of blockchain to customers."
,,,"By leveraging new technologies (Additive Manufacturing, Advanced Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Autonomous Vehicles, Blockchain, Drones, Internet of Things, etc.), many companies are developing cyber-physical systems that can change the competition landscape. In the midst of this exciting development, we examine the strategic role of logistics and transportation services for creating economic, environmental and social values. Also, we discuss some new research directions."
,,,"Recent advances in science mapping allowed to analyze the entire intellectual structure of blockchain and cryptocurrencies in business-related disciplines to identify 174 academic articles as well as 1482 practitioner-oriented articles published since the inception of cryptocurrencies in 2008 to highlight key trends of the published outputs. The results demonstrate academic research done by 389 authors in 296 organizations based in 50 countries that only just initiated the conversation on four major streams of the literatureâ€”Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies; blockchain adoption; cryptocurrency and blockchain environment; and business model innovations. When comparing academic scholarship to practitioner-oriented literature, the results demonstrate that practitioners discussed investor-related themes, cryptocurrency intrinsic value, political-economic sphere, and the impact of cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies on the wider society in greater detail. As a result, a number of themes are identified and discussed that could align academic and practitioner interests and provide guidance for further research in this important field."
,,,"Internet of Things (IoT) has opened up a new dimension for smart farming and agriculture because of the natural feature that makes it possible to assign tasks made by a user or that transfers agriculture data obtained through sensors to producers for analysis on various terminal devices. In recent years, heightened interest in agriculture data has arisen since the commercialization of precision agriculture technology. Agriculture data are known to be messy, especially from combine yield monitors, and analysts are concerned with the validity of data, especially given that other people may have impacted data quality at various steps along the data path. The blockchain can be a possible solution to the analystâ€™s problem of uncertain data quality from prior data manipulation since it ensures data have not been inappropriately manipulated or at the very least documents what changes have been made by specific individuals. This paper proposes a blockchain-based fish farm platform to ensure agriculture data integrity. The designed platform aims to provide fish farmers with secure storage for preserving the large amounts of agriculture data that cannot be tampered with. Diverse processes of the fish farm are executed automatically by using the smart contract to reduce the risk of error or manipulation. A proof of concept that integrates a legacy fish farm system with the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain is implemented on top of the proposed architecture. The efficiency and usability of the proposed platform are demonstrated through a series of experiments using various metrics."
,,,"China wants to embrace blockchain, the technology has triggered a new round of technological innovation and industrial change and has huge potential to enhance sustainable development capabilities in many areas. The purpose of this paper is to explore the global status of Chinaâ€™s blockchain research. This study applies bibliometric analysis to perform statistical and correlation analysis on the blockchain literature from 2013 to 2019 included in the Web of Science (WOS) database and draws the social network with visual analysis technology. The statistical results show that China is the country that publishes the most blockchain papers in the world, leading the global blockchain research. Research institutions and authors from China also dominate global blockchain research. Further, this paper investigates the development process of Chinaâ€™s blockchain research and determines the development stage through a comparative analysis with the United States. More specifically, the paper comprehensively analyzes the current status of Chinaâ€™s blockchain research from three perspectives: the subject area, high-yield institutions and high-yield authors. The results indicate that Chinaâ€™s blockchain research is experiencing rapid growth, and the research scope is constantly expanding, with the research focus gradually shifting to applied research. Finally, this paper summarizes the challenges faced by Chinaâ€™s blockchain research and puts forward corresponding policy recommendations for reference by policy makers."
,,,"The term â€œAgri-Food 4.0â€ is an analogy to the term ""Industry 4.0"", coming from the concept â€œagriculture 4.0â€. Since the origins of the industrial revolution, where the steam engines started the concept of Industry 1.0 and later the use of electricity upgraded the concept to Industry 2.0, the use of technologies generated a milestone in the industry revolution by addressing the Industry 3.0 concept. Hence, Industry 4.0, it is about including and integrating the latest developments based on digital technologies as well as the interoperability process across them. This allows enterprises to transmit real-time information in terms behaviour and performance. Therefore, the challenge is to maintain these complex networked structures efficiently linked and organised within the use of such technologies, especially to identify and satisfy supply chain stakeholders dynamic requirements. In this context, the agriculture domain is not an exception although it possesses some specialities depending from the domain. In fact, all agricultural machinery incorporates electronic controls and has entered to the digital age, enhancing their current performance. In addition, electronics, using sensors and drones, support the data collection of several agriculture key aspects, such as weather, geographical spatialization, animals and crops behaviours, as well as the entire farm life cycle. However, the use of the right methods and methodologies for enhancing agriculture supply chains performance is still a challenge, thus the concept of Industry 4.0 has evolved and adapted to agriculture 4.0 in order analyse the behaviours and performance in this specific domain. Thus, the question mark on how agriculture 4.0 support a better supply chain decision-making process, or how can help to save time to farmer to make effective decision based on objective data, remains open. Therefore, in this survey, a review of more than hundred papers on new technologies and the new available supply chains methods are analysed and contrasted to understand the future paths of the Agri-Food domain."
,,,"Over the last decade, supply-side constraints have resulted in widespread electricity shortage in Pakistan. At its peak, this amounted to over a 7â€¯GW supply-demand gap and caused the electricity grid to be offline for vast swathes of population for many hours daily. Despite major supply-side investments acute shortages persist and a large percentage of relatively affluent households, estimated in millions, have countered this by investing in self-generation and battery storage technologies (usually lead-acid batteries because of their low cost). This paper summarizes the impact of this backup technology on the broader energy system in terms of efficiency losses for households and contribution to low-voltage grid congestion. Research findings suggest that the low efficiency of these backup systems has caused annual losses of around 3â€“4â€¯TWh for the electric grid in Pakistan as well as overloading of transformers and frequent supply-demand imbalances. However, the mass adoption of these backup systems has also created an entire ecosystem which can enable massive demand side management and provide the framework for a future smart grid in Pakistan. Besides evaluating the opportunities, possible policy measures the government should undertake to enable this transition are also discussed."
,,,"To keep the planet on the 2Â°C trajectory, developing countries alone will require US$500 billion annually by 2030 to adequately mitigate their carbon emissions, in addition to several hundred billion additional dollars for adaptation needs. The US$100 billion a year pledged by developed countries through the Green Climate Fund is such insufficient that most of the climate finance required will have to come from the private sector. As a scene-setting chapter, it will delineate the scale of climate investment required, the state of climate finance post-Paris Agreement, climate mitigation and adaptation investment trends, global climate finance landscape, specific hurdles against climate investment, and the problems with climate finance tracking and monitoring. The lack of trust and transparency in the global climate finance landscape provides an excellent ground on which to deploy Blockchain technology to turbo-boost global climate finance flows. This chapter will initiate the discussion on how Blockchain as a â€œtrust machineâ€ could address the many deeply-rooted institutional problems."
,,,"The ongoing digitization of the economy presents challenges and opportunities for the auditing profession and requires both auditors and their clients to adapt. Against the background of current technological developments in big data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain technology, this study examines changes in auditing practices expected by German auditing professionals within the next five to ten years. It addresses the perception of auditing, the auditorâ€“client relationship, regulations, structural and procedural changes for auditing firms, and the profile of the auditing profession. These will probably change with new technologies. We surveyed experts as part of a Delphi study in Germany conducted over two rounds. The results show that no far-reaching changes are expected within the given time horizon. The annual audit will increasingly evolve toward a continuous audit approach. Despite predominantly uncertain opinions, experts believe that new technologies will not replace the auditor, but rather will provide relief and support. Even if the jobâ€™s necessary requirements make it more difficult to remain in the profession, disruptive effects in auditorsâ€™ workplaces are not expected in the near future. Nevertheless, the consequences of using new technologies in the auditing process offer numerous future research opportunities."
,,,"The recent financial crisis has caused a confidence and legitimation deficit in the official monetary system, opening up the space for alternative systems of payment. Bitcoin is one of the most famous incumbents, both for its innovative technology and the opportunities for speculation that it allowed for to the early adopters. This chapter develops a framework for the evolutionary analysis of Bitcoin that combines the theory of money with original institutional economics and its account of institutional change, defined by the principle of ceremonial encapsulation."
,,,"With technology progressing and the decreasing cost of renewable energy, consumers require energy supply to be smarter, cleaner, and more sustainable than before. By providing a decentralized trading mechanism, blockchain technology can facilitate sustainable energy consumption and achieve a circular economy. This study analyzes how China can employ blockchain technology to reform its energy sector. We survey the progress of blockchain technology in the energy sector and explore typical cases of energy blockchains in the world. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of applying blockchain to China's energy sector. China's monopoly market structure in energy supply impedes the application of blockchain technology, but the expansion of clean energy provides a huge opportunity for it. Although China's technological level is lagging, the biggest obstacle is not technology but rather policy. We conclude that China should loosen its regulatory environment, amend the relevant laws, and balance the conflict between management and innovation."
,,,"E-government is an indispensable part of a Smart City. Information and communication technologies transform the relationship between citizens, businesses, and government departments, which enables the implementation of e-government, making operational processes efficient and speedy. This chapter investigates the current deployment strategies and the technological solutions of e-government in terms of security and privacy in a Smart City environment; it also identifies the challenges of adoption. In addition, this chapter proposes a decentralized framework based upon blockchain and artificial intelligence to provide a secure and privacy-preserving infrastructure. The proposed framework integrates technologies to provide mutual trust between individuals, businesses, and governments, leading to a greater transparency of activity and less operational overhead. The reduction in process overhead results in lower running costs (therefore increasing revenue) and improves the speed of cross-boundary transactions."
,,,"Agriculture is a key component of prosperous continuation of human civilization, meeting the basic needs of daily life. Democratization is an inevitable change in the development of political systems. Democratization as a general-purpose technological concept has given birth to a series of individual democratizations such as industrial democratization and financial democratization. Agricultural democratization is generally considered to bring freedom of information, improve agricultural production efficiency and, ultimately, form an open society, though this aspect of democratization is less studied than others.With the progress of science and technology, the practical application of information communication technology and blockchain technology in agriculture gives deeper digital significance to agricultural democratization, thus, further deriving the concept of â€œdigital agricultural democratizationâ€. This paper analyzes summarizes existing concepts, and analyzes the connotations and logical relationships between institutional concepts and technical concepts, such as agricultural democratization, agricultural autocratization, centralization, decentralization, information and communication technology, and blockchain, and proves that democratization and blockchain are general-purpose technologies which have â€œpervasivenessâ€. To realize the coupled nature of technical logic and institutional logic, we here define the concept of â€œdigital agricultural democratizationâ€ which contains three important characteristics. To demonstrate this, we took the Beijing Liuminying Ecological Farm as a case study and proposed a â€œblockchain-based electronic agricultureâ€ framework for its development and challenges. This framework incorporates the entire circular agricultural model of the ecological farm into the blockchain. The blockchain network automatically collects and uploads data through various types of smart devices, which expands the information set that can be used for sharing. This can solve problems such as asymmetric information, unreliable third-party institutions, and poor traceability of organic food. The innovation of the farm's agricultural model provides a powerful example of a novel concept, and illustrates a reliable path for achieving â€œdigital agricultural democratizationâ€."

Included in fintech are innovations in payment systems (including cryptocurrencies), credit markets (including P2P lending), and insurance, with Blockchain-assisted smart contracts playing a role. The paper provides a definition of fintech, examines some statistics and stylized facts, and then reviews the theoretical and empirical literature. The review is organized around four main research questions. The paper summarizes our knowledge on these questions and concludes with questions for future research."
,,,"Blockchain is regarded as a revolutionary technology, which is widely used in different fields all over world, especially for the application in energy field. With the development of distributed generation, thereâ€™s a greater opportunity for distributed generation trading. In the near future, everyone may be able to sell their surplus electricity generated by their rooftop photovoltaic. It can be determined that blockchain can increase the trust between transactors. Blockchain can provide convenience for peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading. In addition, blockchain can be used in other energy fields such as IOT, shared EV charging pile and etc. Because of the above advantages, many countries in the world are developing energy blockchain and have built some applied engineering programs. Some representative projects in US are introduced in this paper, and advanced technologies adopted in these existing projects are also analyzed. Finally, suggestions for developing energy blockchain technology and conclusions are given."
,,,"Blockchain technologies have captured the imagination of scholars, managers, and practitioners around the world. It is widely accepted by these actors that blockchain is not a buzzword, but a highly disruptive technology that is already remodeling the organizations and their supply chain business models. Despite the meaningful advance in the last years, blockchain applications regarding the operations and supply chain management (OSCM) are still in their infancy. Little is known about the role of blockchain in terms of operations traceability, as well in areas such as e-commerce, agriculture, public services, etc. Therefore, this Special Issue seeks to extend our understanding of blockchain applications in OSCM and how firms create and capture business value with blockchain. To this effect, this Special Issue will provide a well-articulated and in-depth discussion of the role of blockchain in creating value in the domain of OSCM. Specifically, it is expected that more light is shed on how blockchain integrates with and impacts new business models, transforms relationships, and improves performance and competitive advantage in OSCM. Also, the evolution of blockchain was reviewed in order to provide a strong background to the readers. The literature review was performed taking into account a bibliometric perspective of blockchain-related publications. The review supports the importance of this Special Issue by highlighting the urgent needs of this topic in this reputable journal. Finally, we provide future research directions and a guide for the papers presented in this Special Issue."
,,,"Decentralization of energy network is the way that production will be close to consumption. It reduces energy lost and carbon emission thanks to applying more DERs and RESs especially wind turbines and PV systems. Moreover the reliability, sustainability, and stability of the network will increase thanks to local production instead of central power plants. Decentralization can be performed by various market schemes based on available infrastructure and technologies in a region. Accordingly, blockchain can better integrate current market players to provide energy balance. Moreover, it can incentivized new players through special smart contracts. For example, electric vehicles (EVs) can be paid for their active role as energy supplier or demand response provider. This chapter studies the role of market participants in new structure of business model within blockchain-based platform."
,,,"The aim of this paper is to develop an intelligent cyber-physical system for the waste management in a locality which will not only keep records of the use of the trash bins in the but also ensure they have an additional blockchain based verification system which will ensure the proper working even in the presence of an adversary. The proposed system is an ensemble of the database server, blockchain server, embedded system based clients and an android app. This is inspired by the recent global trend in smartphone popularity which has piqued interest in the above mentioned division. The advent of smartphone popularity helps us to create an ideal system for a plethora of reasons such as processing capability and native storage etc. Furthermore, blockchain technology, introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 ensures decentralization and security of transactions due to its use of cryptographic hash functions and public key cryptographic system. To further excite the situation, India recently revised its solid waste management policy in 2016 after 16 long years. All of the above factors together pointed to creation of a smart waste management system to prevent further exacerbation of Indiaâ€™s existing waste management crisis."
,,,"Rural areas in developing countries have constantly been plagued by poor sanitation and energy shortages. A key issue has been the decentralized nature of waste generation and energy consumption, leading to farmers burning crop stocks, lumber, and other agricultural waste. As 1.9 billion people lack access to waste collection services [1], untreated solid and liquid refuse hamper the health of many and irreversibly damage the local ecosystem. Considering the scattered nature of agricultural waste generation and centralized treatment difficulties, this study examines the feasibility of adopting decentralized blockchain system in trading biomass energy and agricultural products across the waste-to-energy ecosystem. A case study is conducted based on the Yitong system in Changzhi City, Shanxi Province, China. This plant collects and transports agricultural wastes (crop straw and animal residue), and converts them to clean energy and agricultural by-products like briquettes, fertilizer, and animal feedstock. This paper presents how a digital coupon or cryptocurrency can be introduced to trade the wastes, energy and by-products among the farmers and entrepreneurs. It argues that this system could maximize the use of agriculture wastes by incentivizing farmers and enterprises to work together. This paper covers three key areas:1) Literature review, methodology preparation, and field assessment for introducing digital incentive mechanism to enhance rural wastes management.2) Design of a prototype of blockchain-based model: (a) how the waste-to-energy plant managers collect the segregated waste from individual farmers through trucks connected to blockchain-based smart meters; (b) how systems on each of the trucks register the quantity of waste received onto a universal ledger when collecting. This quantity received will be translated into a certain amount of energy and products like fertilizer that the waste-to-energy plant owes each farm; and (c) how the farmers will receive digital coupons corresponding to the quantity of energy and agricultural products that they should receive.3) Evaluation of the feasibility of blockchain-based model (technical and economic): (a) data collection on the total quantity of waste produced and the processing capabilities and availability of Waste to Energy plants; (b) assessing readiness of digital infrastructure (cyber-security and communications); and (c) economic evaluation of the incentives and responsibilities associated with the key stakeholders from the farmers to enterprises."
,,,"Blockchain is not the first -and certainly will not be the last- network fever we will experience. This paper shows how blockchain networks will disrupt the urban context as well, similarly to what it is happening in the fintech and insurtech spaces, among many other emerging application domains. We put forward the Future Living Framework as the meta use case of a wider research called Blockchain4Cities. In this use case, which uses UN's New Urban Agenda (NUA) as exemplifying model, we show the benefits of using blockchain in the urban field and we do so by breaking down the NUA in policies, planning, regulations and standards and dissecting these further into Quito's Implementation Plan (QIP) themes and scopes. Use case results confirm that blockchain will disrupt urban networks, like Cybernetics did in 1948, Ekistics a decade later, and the Metabolists and Webbists in the late sixties. The Ubiquitous Computing arrived later, in the seventies, and disrupted all the previous network efforts, lasting until the current Internet of Things (IoT) and its sister concept Smart Cities, when IoT is used in an urban context. Blockchain is here to take on and be the next network for cities."
,,,"Medical data has become an essential element for industrial healthcare. The growth in medical data is accompanied by the need to process it in a secure manner. As the infrastructure of this industry consists of connected devices and software applications that communicate with other IT systems, the industrial healthcare market will be greatly impacted by the use of blockchain and the Internet of Things (IoT). These technologies will improve processing efficiency, the creation of business opportunities, requirement regulation, information security, and transparency. While sharing electronic health records can assist in improving diagnosis accuracy, privacy and security preservation are imperative. In the network of IoT devices, that exchange involves sensitive medical data; patient monitoring has to be totally secured against privacy risks and attacks. Delays in treatment progress and emergency treatments could also result in medical data security and confidentiality violations. Applying blockchain technology to the healthcare industry could improve information security management; healthcare data could be analyzed and communicated while preserving the privacy and security of the data. Here we critically look at how these two key technologies (blockchain and IoT) â€“ especially blockchain â€“ will impact the healthcare industry."
,,,"This paper explores the usage of Blockchain Technology for Land Records Management in India. It highlights issues, such as minimal transparency, accountability, incoherent data sets with different Government Departments pertaining to the same piece of land and delays in the current Land Records management process and how to overcome these problems using Blockchain Technology. The paper describes the current process of land records maintenance and land registration in the country, and discusses various challenges encountered during the implementation of Blockchain Technology like public key infrastructure and Internet, privacy rules and security issues. Finally, the paper illustrates a system design using Blockchain Technology for the implementation of Land Titling system in the country, so that land titles are tamper-proof, and provides authentic and conclusive rights on ownership."
,,,"The internet of things (IoT) enabled a common operating picture (COP) across the various applications of modern day living. The COP is achieved through the advancements seen in wireless sensor network devices that were able to communicate through the network thereby exchanging information and performing various analysis. In IoT, the exchange of information and data authentication is only done through the central server there by leading to the security and privacy concerns. Chances of device spoofing, false authentication, less reliability in data sharing could happen. To address such security and privacy concerns, a central server concept is eliminated and blockchain (BC) technology is introduced as a part of IoT. This paper elaborates the possible security and privacy issues considering the component interaction in IoT and studies how the distributed ledger based blockchain (DL-BC) technology contribute to it. Applications of BC with respect to focused sectors and category were clearly studied here. Various challenges specific to IoT and IoT with BC were also discussed to understand blockchain technology contribution."
,,,"Integrated with Smart Contract, Blockchain technology realizes much wider applications through allowing automatic execution of obligations, reduction of costs, increase of security, and improvement of analytics in upscaling climate actions. In this chapter, we discuss some distinct features of Blockchain technology and explore its potential applications in enforcing climate change law and green finance regulations. Specifically, this chapter provides both international and Chinaâ€™s use cases on how Blockchain technology can boost climate actions. Also covered are the challenges and opportunities facing local and international regulations to further unleash the potential of Blockchain technology in mobilizing green finance with recommendations of legal framework reform.

,,,"The Covid-19 pandemic has led to an inevitable surge in the use of digital technologies due to the social distancing norms and nationwide lockdowns. People and organizations all over the world have had to adjust to new ways of work and life. We explore possible scenarios of the digital surge and the research issues that arise. An increase in digitalization is leading firms and educational institutions to shift to work-from-home (WFH). Blockchain technology will become important and will entail research on design and regulations. Gig workers and the gig economy is likely to increase in scale, raising questions of work allocation, collaboration, motivation, and aspects of work overload and presenteeism. Workplace monitoring and technostress issues will become prominent with an increase in digital presence. Online fraud is likely to grow, along with research on managing security. The regulation of the internet, a key resource, will be crucial post-pandemic. Research may address the consequences and causes of the digital divide. Further, the issues of net neutrality and zero-rating plans will merit scrutiny. A key research issue will also be the impact and consequences of internet shutdowns, frequently resorted to by countries. Digital money, too, assumes importance in crisis situations and research will address their adoption, consequences, and mode. Aspects of surveillance and privacy gain importance with increased digital usage."
,,,"Blockchain technology could be transformational in democratizing global energy supply. This chapter offers three case studies on how this is beginning to happen, explores four central assertions, and offers the verdict that those who decide the rules will dictate if Blockchain is to successfully democratize global energy supply. The assertions are: firstly, centralized power equals magnified inequalities and less democracy, with energy supply currently overwhelmingly centralized; second, the paradox of the Internet is that by decentralizing participation, the Internet (via the â€œgiantsâ€ such as Apple, Google, etc.) centralizes authority; third, we must ensure both decentralized participation and authority if we are to fulfil the democratic promise of Blockchain technology. Last, energy supply is ripe for democratization by Blockchains. The three case studies demonstrating how Blockchains are already democratizing energy supply are LO3â€™s Brooklyn Microgrid, The Sun Exchange and SolarCoin."
,,,"This paper discusses the emergence of blockchain technology in the energy sector in the light of ongoing energy market transformation. The study builds on literature research and expert interviews, and provides insights into the future energy landscape in the context of the blockchain advent. While the interviewees acknowledge the great, though disruptive, potential of blockchain technology for the primary activities in the electricity sector, there is agreement that inflexible regulatory frameworks impose the biggest challenge. The widest impact which blockchain technology will have in the short-term will be in electric vehicle integration, while in the long-term blockchain will enable peer-to-peer microgrids. The role that the blockchain will play, though, relies mainly on the business model innovation in energy. While a growing body of literature discusses specific blockchain applications and solutions in an advanced technological set-up, this paper presents a holistic picture of the blockchain applicability in the energy sector and thematises this very powerful and versatile technology against the background of two emerging economies: South Africa and Russia."
,,,"Blockchains or distributed ledgers are an emerging technology that has drawn considerable interest from energy supply firms, startups, technology developers, financial institutions, national governments and the academic community. Numerous sources coming from these backgrounds identify blockchains as having the potential to bring significant benefits and innovation. Blockchains promise transparent, tamper-proof and secure systems that can enable novel business solutions, especially when combined with smart contracts. This work provides a comprehensive overview of fundamental principles that underpin blockchain technologies, such as system architectures and distributed consensus algorithms. Next, we focus on blockchain solutions for the energy industry and inform the state-of-the-art by thoroughly reviewing the literature and current business cases. To our knowledge, this is one of the first academic, peer-reviewed works to provide a systematic review of blockchain activities and initiatives in the energy sector. Our study reviews 140 blockchain research projects and startups from which we construct a map of the potential and relevance of blockchains for energy applications. These initiatives were systematically classified into different groups according to the field of activity, implementation platform and consensus strategy used.11A summary of the research projects reviewed in this study can be found in the Appendix A. Opportunities, potential challenges and limitations for a number of use cases are discussed, ranging from emerging peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading and Internet of Things (IoT) applications, to decentralised marketplaces, electric vehicle charging and e-mobility. For each of these use cases, our contribution is twofold: first, in identifying the technical challenges that blockchain technology can solve for that application as well as its potential drawbacks, and second in briefly presenting the research and industrial projects and startups that are currently applying blockchain technology to that area. The paper ends with a discussion of challenges and market barriers the technology needs to overcome to get past the hype phase, prove its commercial viability and finally be adopted in the mainstream."
,,,"Arrival of blockchain is set to transform supply chain activities. Scholars have barely begun to systematically assess the effects of blockchain on various organizational activities. This paper examines how blockchain is likely to affect key supply chain management objectives such as cost, quality, speed, dependability, risk reduction, sustainability and flexibility. We present early evidence linking the use of blockchain in supply chain activities to increase transparency and accountability. Case studies of blockchain projects at various phases of development for diverse purposes are discussed. This study illustrates the various mechanisms by which blockchain help achieve the above supply chain objectives. Special emphasis has been placed on the roles of the incorporation of the IoT in blockchain-based solutions and the degree of deployment of blockchain to validate individualsâ€™ and assetsâ€™ identities."
,,,"Novel technologies are continually being developed every day. Lessons from the past show that some resulted in unintended harm to the Earthâ€™s system. The challenge for organizations working at the interface of the environment, technology, and society is, therefore, how to best harness the environmental benefits from new technologies while minimizing their potential adverse effects. Here, we identify some of the emerging technologies that the international development community needs to consider as it seeks to take advantage of new technologies to promote sustainable development. There are several innovations â€“ such as blockchain, nanotechnology, synthetic biology, cellular agriculture, and gene editing techniques that could either positively or negatively affect the environment, food security, human health, and the transition to clean energy. Some of their benefits and potential environmental and socio-economic concerns are discussed. We further suggest actions that can be taken by organizations involved in sustainable development, such as the United Nations and other global and regional bodies, to exploit the benefits from novel technologies and mitigate their risks."
,,,"Social sustainability is a major concern in global supply chains for protecting workers from exploitation and for providing a safe working environment. Although there are stipulated standards to govern supply chain social sustainability, it is not uncommon to hear of businesses being reported for noncompliance issues. Even reputable firms such as Unilever have been criticized for production labor exploitation. Consumers now increasingly expect sellers to disclose information on social sustainability, but sellers are confronted with the challenge of traceability in their multi-tier global supply chains. Blockchain offers a promising future to achieve instant traceability in supply chain social sustainability. This study develops a system architecture that integrates the use of blockchain, internet-of-things (IoT) and big data analytics to allow sellers to monitor their supply chain social sustainability efficiently and effectively. System implementation cost and potential challenges are analyzed before the research is concluded."
,,,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is experiencing an exponential growth in a wide variety of use-cases in multiple application domains, such as healthcare, agriculture, smart cities, smart homes, supply chain, and so on. To harness its full potential, it must be based upon a resilient network architecture with strong support for security, privacy, and trust. Most of these issues still remain to be addressed carefully for the IoT systems. Blockchain technology has recently emerged as a breakthrough technology with the potential to deliver some valuable properties such as resiliency, support for integrity, anonymity, decentralization, and autonomous control. A number of blockchain platforms are proposed that may be suitable for different use-cases including IoT applications. In such, the possibility to integrate the IoT and blockchain technology is seen as a potential solution to address some crucial issues. However, to achieve this, there must be a clear understanding of the requirements of different IoT applications and the suitability of a blockchain platform for a particular application satisfying its underlying requirements. This chapter aims to achieve this goal by describing an evaluation framework which can be utilized to select a suitable blockchain platform for a given IoT application."
,,,"Rapid ICT development, globalization challenges, intellectual property (IP) as indicators of economic development, and the challenge are the patentability of computer-implemented inventions and artificial intelligence implications for the IP Office (IPO) to transform from the digital paradigm to the smart paradigm. Nevertheless, because of the lack of literature on the smart IPO framework, we refer to smart government and smart city framework. The aim of this paper is to propose a framework for smart IPO in developing countries in the context of smart city framework. The study found that smart IPO composed of several components such as 1) Smart IPO Model; 2) Smart IPO Enterprise Architecture; 3) Smart IPO Collaboration Model; 4) Smart IPO Development Model; 5) Smart IPO Measurement Model; 6) Smart IPO Standard; and 7) Smart IPO Services. It also found that there are four models of IP office as follows: Model 1 (basic web-based, public services); Model 2 (advanced internal administration); Model 3 (full process automation); and Model 4 (knowledge-based IP services). Moreover, we found also three stages of IP development model: Stage 1 (automation of internal processes); Stage 2 (web-based e-services); Stage 3 (e-dossier, e-filing, e-payment)."
,,,"Although the fintech subject has been widely discussed in the press and communications media, there is a lack of consensus on the definition of the term in the scientific literature and the key research topics and trends. Aiming to narrow this gap, the objective of this study is to investigate the concept of fintech, to map the literature and point out new routes and opportunities in the field. For this purpose, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is performed, attempting to describe the areas of fintech activities, propose a categorization for this literature, highlight the main issues dealt with to date in the sample publications, as well as to point out new questions for continuing research in this field. The results show a set of definitions for the term fintech and suggest as a comprehensive understanding of fintech, as innovative companies active in the financial industry making use of the availability of communication, the ubiquity of the internet, and the automated processing of information. Moreover, the literature focuses on financial services and innovations, dealing with issues of financial industry regulation and local legislation or the financial system globally. The innovation of research subcategories (technology adoption/network externalities), blockchain and security appear with great emphasis in this work and represent the current most sensitive aspects also linked to the more global theme of digital transformation. Finally, subjects related to financial services operation particularly deal with risks of financial loss related to different factors involved in the business environment of these organizations."
,,,"The management of energy supply and demand is becoming more challenging, especially in regions where the demand continues to grow rapidly and more intermittent renewable supply sources are added to the energy infrastructure. In this context, Demand Side Management (DSM) can be employed to align supply and demand and improve reliability of the system under supply constraints and stretch the capacity limits of the existing grid infrastructure. A game theoretic approach for a DSM model incorporating storage components is suggested in this paper especially for environments with energy supply constraints. The proposed model is able to not only reduce the Peak-to-Average ratio to benefit the electrical grid, but can also smoothen the dips in the load profile caused by supply constraints. In a case study to demonstrate the value of the model presented, a variety of residential demand types are evaluated within a micro-grid to maximize the payoff utility of both individual users and the whole system. Moreover, emerging blockchain technologies are introduced to guarantee the seamless and secure implementation of the proposed scheme, illustrating how a decentralized demand side management approach could be implemented in practice to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions following optimized demand profiles."
,,,"This chapter provides recommendations for transferring value between different Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects over distributed ledgers. The recommendations provided are conceptual and based upon features and protocols available currently. New Market Mechanisms can also exchange digital carbon credits within their individual mechanisms, on a multinational level using various Blockchain networks. Global partnerships will be nurtured by providing a platform with embedded fiduciary instruments to areas having limited digital infrastructure. Creating a single Blockchain token that is compliant with all global, national, and subnational regulations, at the onset, is unrealistic; but, we can expect cryptocurrencies to create greater value than traditionally issued Carbon Emission Reduction (CER) credits. Discussion will convert as to how CDM projects can benefit from Blockchain improvements. The CDM can transition legacy data into new Blockchain tools creating greater value with a borderless ledger of immutable data that increase liquidity of CERs and shortens the validation processes."
,,,"Climate change has a disproportionate impact on the worldâ€™s poor. Developing countries will require tens of billions of dollars in new funding annually to adapt to climate changes. Financial Technology (FinTech) and Blockchain innovations can play a major role in implementing these adaptation plans. Blockchain innovations can help build trust and transparency in international climate finance and could potentially have major implications in scaling and speeding up north-south, south-south, and peer-to-peer climate finance transfers. This chapter will explore the potential of Blockchain to provide scalable solutions in the areas of: tracking climate finance, results tracking, climate adaptation, financial inclusion, and identity. It will discuss requirements to achieve scale, including building the ecosystem by linking Blockchain developers, and funding sources with people working on problems of poverty. The big problems of our time need bold, collaborative solutions."
,,,"Much of the attention surrounding blockchain today is focused on financial services, with very little discussion about nonfinancial services firms and how blockchain technology may affect organizations, their business models, and how they create and deliver value. In addition, some confusion remains between the blockchain (with definite article) and blockchain (no article), distributed ledger technologies, and their applications. Our article offers a primer on blockchain technology aimed at general managers and executives. The key contributions of this article lie in providing an explanation of blockchain, including how a blockchain transaction works and a clarification of terms, and outlining different types of blockchain technologies. We also discuss how different types of blockchain impact business models. Building on the well-established business model framework by Osterwalder and Pigneur, we outline the effect that blockchain technologies can have on each element of the business model, along with illustrations from firms developing blockchain technology."
,,,"This chapter describes how mobile technologies are expanding digital financial inclusion, defined as providing access and delivery of basic banking services, savings, lending, insurance and other financial services to everyone in the populationâ€”especially those who live under the poverty line. The World Bank estimates that over 38 percent of adults in the world, or about two billion adults are unbanked, having no access to formal banking services. Financial inclusion helps those unbanked and underbanked bridge the gaps between the physical, digital and psychological use and access to money. In today's digital world, physical cash is rapidly becoming a remnant of traditional societal mores and legacy financial systems that have disadvantaged the unbanked. By combining digital financial tools (such as mobile remittances using blockchain technology) with psychological tools (such as financial education), the unbanked can attain financial services and break out of the poverty cycle."
,,,"Supply chain finance (SCF) aims to improve the overall creditability of the entire supply chain, including buyers, suppliers, and financial service providers, through an inter-organizational approach. In SCF, companies will collaborate with each other to maximise the mutual benefits. Companies, such as those involving suppliers, may sell their invoices to banks or any other financial service provider at a discount in order to cash in the invoices immediately for achieving better cash flow. Accordingly, the role of financial service providers becomes the most critical because they control the discount rates offered, while bearing all the risks, which is why they are also known as the risk takers. In existing literature and in practice, the discount rate is usually determined by the relationship between buyers and financial service providers. Therefore, it is necessary to understand what factors are considered during decision-making and whether the traditional collaborative factors considered in the literature on supply chain collaboration are still valid. So far, the supply chain collaborative factors have not been studied scientifically from the point of view of financial service providers. Therefore, in this work, we investigated how important these factors are for financial service providers. We identified the most important factors from the literature on supply chain collaboration and conducted interviews with many experienced practitioners in financial service industries in China. We employed interpretive structural modelling to model the relationship between collaborative factors and understand the importance of each factor. The results revealed that top management support, trust, and IT infrastructure are the factors considered the most important by financial service providers. Interestingly, we also found that incentives are the least important factors in SCF."
,,,"The new technologies/information technologies have contributed effectively to the medication health care during the last decades. Adapting new technologies/information technologies, mobile technologies, and social media could contribute effectively to the medications safety practice such as pharmacovigilance (PV), medication errors, drug-related problems (DRPs), and other safety practices. This chapter aims to discuss the impact of technology on drug development and clinical trials, PV, medication errors prevention, DRPs prevention, and counterfeit medicine fighting."
,,,"Globalization and free trade policies coupled with consumersâ€™ demand for safe and high-quality foods have created pressure on various stakeholders (key players) attached within the agri-food supply chain. Influence, contributions, and socioeconomic and environmental factors are major players in achieving a successful flow of supply chain. Globally, various techniques and conceptual models have been proposed to render the agri-food supply chain effective and profitable. However, there are still several gaps and emerging challenges in the supply chain hindering fruitful, sustainable food production. In this chapter, an attempt has been made to identify and highlight the present world scenario and challenges encountered along the agri-food supply chain and its future prospects."
,,,"Despite the usefulness of computer-assisted audit tools and techniques (CAATTs) in increasing audit productivity and reducing costs, their adoption by audit firms is low in developing countries. The aim of this study is to investigate whether organizational and environmental factors can help explain CAATTs adoption in less developed countries, such as Malaysia. The research framework was developed based on the Technology-Organization-Environment framework (TOE). The results reveal that for environmental factors, the complexity of clients' accounting information systems (AIS) and perceived level of support of professional accounting bodies (PABs) affect CAATTs adoption. For organizational factors, firm size, top management commitment and employee IT competency were found to be significant factors. Moreover, firm size partially moderates the influence of clients' AIS complexity on CAATTs adoption. This paper contributes to existing adoption theory by extending our understanding of the impact of factors unique to CAATTs adoption."
,,,"â€œData is the new Oil,â€ is a well-known notion first coined by UK mathematician and business strategist Clive Humby1. But while data has undoubtedly assumed this pre-eminent role in the current digital era, the fact remains that protecting data from theft and illegal usage is a far more onerous task than securing oil ever was."
,,,"Cash, standardized physical tokens that represent economic value, has been a key instrument in the evolution of human civilizations for around 3000 years. However in the last few decades cash has been progressively losing its preeminence in favour of electronic handling of money transactions. The shift to a cashless society, in which physical money is completely or almost completely replaced by electronic records is on the horizon. Regardless of its advantages and disadvantages, electronic handling of money needs the support of a complex technological infrastructure which operation depends on many factors. This paper discusses this subject in detail, identifies the main threats linked to electronic money handling and evaluates their possible impacts on societies that no longer rely on cash."
,,,"The objective of this study is to review the extant sharing economy (SE) literature. Applying a systematic literature review approach, this study thematically synthesizes the findings of 219 articles on sharing economy. It explores the definitional dilemma, sharing economy as a phenomenon and key theories used in the literature. It analyses the stakeholders and their motivations for participating in SE, which is mainly present in the accommodation and transportation sectors. We discuss various facets of these two sectors. The study shows how SE firms operate with novel business models with unique revenue streams. It synthesizes the challenges that SE faces. This study points out SEâ€™s economic, social, and environmental impacts. It highlights the lack of regulations and policies for SE around the world. Finally, we provide the implications of this work and suggest future research avenues."
,,,"In this concept paper, we will address several critical questions: how can we enhance smart use of precious resources, support environmental sustainability and assist the developing world in their growth process? We put forward a policy framework that can potentially address these three questions and in addition could represent a critical step towards a circular economy eliminating the need for a post-resource discussion. Using precious metals as an example, we present a novel concept that combines policy, business and technological aspects aimed at making efficient use of finite resources and distributing the revenue more evenly. This approach could hence create jobs and eliminate the need of a post-resource discussion for post-industrial economies. Moreover, we will illustrate herein how this approach could be the initial step of the leapfrogging to a post-resource economy with maximized employment. Furthermore, the advance of some emerging technologies, such as block chain and associated smart contracts could be leveraged to track the primary asset being leased. We also note the broader impact on sustainability and economics with the implications of such a model in driving a circular economy, encouraging GDP growth, addressing resource â€œscarcityâ€ and on the environment."
,,,"Covid-19 has severely tested our public health systems. Recovering from Covid-19 will soon test our economic systems. Innovation will have an important role to play in recovering from the aftermath of the coronavirus. This article discusses both how to manage innovation as part of that recovery, and also derives some lessons from how we have responded to the virus so far, and what those lessons imply for managing innovation during the recovery."
,,,"Smart cities are rapidly developing in the world. Their sustainability needs to be achieved based on transformative urban systems design from system of systems perspective. Especially, to conduct evidence-based assessments, our new approach will use big data and analytics tools to support urban planner's decisions. The use of data science, analytics, and visualization will play important role to codesign urban systems with local stakeholders. This chapter outlines performance-based urban systems design. The modeling involves the use of metrics through analytical tools to evaluate sustainability of urban systems. Both qualitative (e.g., comfort level) and quantitative (e.g., CO2 emission) properties are modeled focusing on factors such as performance, experiential, and people's flow. Performance metrics are used as tools for evaluating current and predict potential future of different urban forms to support decision-makings."

,,,"This chapter recaps the contribution of this book by revisiting the questions of the global debate identified in Chapter 3 to examine how many of these questions now have answers, to identify those areas where there are â€˜still more questions than answersâ€™, and to compile a list of unanswered questions which need to be the preoccupation of future researchers. The conclusions of this book highlight that a MaaS future embraces a very appealing mobility strategy; however, we are in the very early days in our understanding of how best to facilitate a MaaS future. Needing more research is an inevitable conclusion."
,,,"The setting up of the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU) at Sussex University 50 years ago represented a â€œtransformative changeâ€ in the research on science policy and the understanding of the nature and origin of technological change and innovation studies. It influenced policymakers across the world in both the mature Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries and the developing world. It made the topic of science, technology and innovation (STI) familiar to business studies scholars. Today though, the analysis of STI appears to be somewhat in crisis. On the one hand, there is growing evidence that the growth and welfare gains of new technologies and innovation are no longer forthcoming in an automatic â€œtrickle-downâ€ fashion. The knowledge and technology diffusion â€œmachineâ€ appears broken. On the other hand, there are growing environmental concerns about the negative externalities of unsustainable fossil-fuel-based growth as industrialization spreads across the globe. STI policy appears somehow stuck in an industrial efficiency and consumerism mode that is unable to address in a satisfactory way the impact of such negative externalities. Can the broader historical approach as popularized within the so-called Science and Technology Studies (STS) tradition provide additional, complementary insights? Yes, if STI and STS scholars are prepared to leave their respective conceptual comfort zones and address in complementary fashion some of the major societal policy challenges confronting science, technology and innovation policy today."
,,,"Recently, with the development of â€œIndustry 4.0â€, â€œOil and Gas 4.0â€ has also been put on the agenda in the past two years. Some companies and experts believe that â€œOil and Gas 4.0â€ can completely change the status quo of the oil and gas industry, which can bring huge benefits because it accelerates the digitization and intelligentization of the oil and gas industry. However, the â€œOil and Gas 4.0â€ is still in its infancy. Therefore, this paper systematically introduces the concept and core technologies of â€œOil and Gas 4.0â€, such as big data and the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Moreover, this paper analyzes typical application scenarios of the oil and gas industry chain (upstream, midstream and downstream) through examples, such as intelligent oilfield, intelligent pipeline, and intelligent refinery. It is concluded that the essence of â€œOil and Gas 4.0â€ is a data-driven intelligence system based on the highly digitization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first academic peer-reviewed paper on the â€œOil and Gas 4.0â€ era, aiming to let more oil and gas industry personnel understand its benefits and application scenarios, so as to better apply it to practical engineering in the future. In the discussion section, this paper also analyzes the opportunities and difficulties that may be brought about by the â€œOil and Gas 4.0â€ era. Finally, relevant policy recommendations are proposed."
,,,"Over the past more than four decades, several theoretical models have been developed to understand the acceptance and use of information systems. Realising the dilemma in selecting the appropriate theoretical model to assess the acceptance and use of technology and considering the pattern of using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), a modified version (meta-UTAUT) has been developed based on the synthesis of results from 162 existing studies. The aim of this article is to review the emerging literature on meta-UTAUT and offer some future research recommendations. The analysis suggests that studies have started citing the relationships suggested by meta-UTAUT and researchers have reviewed it alongside other alternative models while analysing acceptance and use of technology."
,,,"The shutdown in February 2015 of the Hong Kong Bitcoin exchange, MyCoin, added new proof to the already rich group of those claiming that Bitcoin is nothing more than a vector facilitating not only financial crime but crime in general. However, Bitcoin as well as other cryptocurrencies are the pioneers of a new economy that will address many of the current issues of digital trade including intellectual property rights, company shares, etc. As a new financial tool with financial value and features of both a commodity and a currency, cryptocurrencies are currently not fully understood and not covered by full-fledged regulation. Therefore, cryptocurrency is used in many financial crimes. Some of the crimes are it as a support for dissimulating classic crimes (e.g., money laundering, silkroad.com payments, etc.). Other crimes are specific to cryptocurrencies like double spending, Ponzi schemes, on crypto-investment, electronic theft, and so on. Tackling cryptocrime is a task similar to taking a close picture of the horizon. Even when Bitcoin and other versions are regulated, new ways of circumventing cryptocurrencies will emerge."
,,,"Conventional land tenure recording approaches to create a sustainable land administration system (LAS) have been found to be of limited value in developing countries. To respond to this challenge, the â€˜fit-for-purposeâ€™ (FFP) approach was developed. This approach has gained relevance in the last years and promotes the use of new technologies like unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to provide valuable base maps. Yet, contemporary failures demonstrate that technological innovations should consider the governance context when being implemented. Understanding the relevance of the FFP approach and acknowledging the importance of institutional factors in policy implementation, this research presents and applies the â€˜Fit-for-purpose governance assessment frameworkâ€™ (FGAF). The FGAF operationalises the seven elements of the FFP approach with five governance dimensions of the framework named Governance Assessment Tool (GAT). To apply FGAF, our selected case study is focused on the UAVs implementation in Rwanda. We conducted 37 semi-structured in-depth interviews, a pilot project with Rwandese stakeholders, and analysed several official documents and national reports. Additionally, UAV data collection was carried out to test the performance of the technology too. This research found that participation and flexibility are the governance qualities that present the main challenges, while inclusiveness, affordability, upgradability, attainability and reliability provide better opportunities to implement UAVs. Based on our case study, we conclude that the governance context favours a top-down approach for the implementation of the UAV technology in the LAS. For the sustainability of the LAS, the central government should incentivize participatory governance models for local and non-governmental actors. Also, strengthening the capacities of the field agencies at the district level through fiscal decentralisation can support the effective uptake of the UAV technologies in the LAS."
,,,"The emergence of citizen-based power systems in an integrated grid has been anticipated for decades. We can reveal how this is emerging in practice due to the significant uptake of solar photovoltaics (solar PV) and now battery storage in Perth, Australia. The high cost of electricity, high radiant energy levels and easy access to cheap Chinese technology, has led to dramatic buying during Perth's recent boomtown years. The traditional uni-directional power system is rapidly disrupting and this paper assesses where this may lead and what it means for the grid. Results of detailed monitoring in a solar powered house along with the impact of a battery storage system show the impact on the traditional grid is substantial but it will still be needed and must therefore adapt to the new distributed, bi-directional energy system. Surveys and price trajectories reveal how the trends to solar power storage will continue and how a citizen utility paradigm will emerge as the future grid building block using new blockchain support systems. Responses from utilities are then see to be fight, flight or innovate."
,,,"Quite interesting developments are occurring on the African financial landscape. The growth of mobile payments services; agent banking; the increase in the use of crowdfunding mechanisms to raise finance; and the growing interest in the use of cryptocurrencies by Africans to transact have all contributed to this trend. A common factor running through these recent developments is their ability to facilitate financial inclusion. Another characteristic they all share is that they all have cross-border dimensions. This therefore requires a coordinated approach to regulation, of which a regional regulatory approach is likely to play a prominent role. The increasing speed of these developments in this era of financial technology calls for the urgent institution of a robust regional financial regulatory framework that addresses key issues raised by them and which this chapter considers."
,,,"Globalization introduces incertitude for the future of companies. They could disappear more quickly for economic reasons or increase exponentially their position on the market (profit, turnover). Indeed, Logistics and task force costs are important for implementing a new factory in a country. Then, the concurrence is unequal for European and developed countries. Industry of the future appears in this context as a new method based on new technologies deployment (and organization) for improving company performance. Many concepts are being developed in the frame of â€œfactory of the futureâ€. Most of them, insist only on new technology integration everywhere in manufacturing processes or on company supply chains. Thus, industrial problems could be solved very quickly by using machines, robots, cobots, RFID, but also internet of thing (IoT), decision aided tools, etc. Some of them integrate social aspects in their framework. But, none of them are based on sustainability in future changes. The main objective of this new framework is to put this sustainability as the kernel of future company evolutions in the frame of â€˜Industry 4.0â€™. This paper will focus on concepts of this new factory framework for defining changes and steps in the frame of factory of the future. Based on sustainability (social, societal and environmental dimensions), and in addition to new technologies and organization, flexibility in company position would be added as one of main development factors. After presenting concepts and formalisms of this new framework and how they could be used on a company, a detailed illustration example will be shown for validating concepts elaborated. In this paper, artificial intelligence (machine learning, expert systems, multi-agent systems) will also be used for defining the structure of a decision aided tool in order to optimize company dispatching flows."
,,,"In recent years, with the emphasis on environmental protection, the global energy landscape is changing: the proportion of traditional energy is gradually decreasing, and renewable energy are developing rapidly. In this context, the oil and gas company is also in the early stages of the low-carbon emission energy transition. However, this concept is relatively new for many oil and gas companies. Thus, this paper aims to introduce the low-carbon emission transition practices of several large oil and gas companies so that more companies can learn from the experience. This paper summarizes the transition targets, investment, and actions of some large oil and gas companies employing enterprise surveys, and analyses the low-carbon transition paths, opportunities, and challenges. The analysis shows that (1) vigorous development of natural gas business is the first step for oil and gas companies to transition to low-carbon emission stage; (2) increasing investment in renewable energy is a long-term action of oil and gas companies and the key to transforming oil and gas companies into integrated energy companies; (3) oil and gas companies should have rich experience in developing geothermal energy. In addition, the paper also proposes policy recommendations for the low-carbon transition of oil and gas companies."

,,,"Humans communicate their activities and performance in several ways (word of mouth, signs, written language, webpage, social networks, etc.). Currently, businesses use different mechanisms to communicate their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities to foster their reputation, consumer loyalty and social recognition. Meanwhile, sceptic firms use CSR communication as a mere whitewashing strategy. Using a triangulation methodology for Spanish quoted firms (IBEX-35), this paper aims to identify the main CSR communication channels. Our study concludes that CSR communication will undergo constant change due to the evolution of communication mechanisms."
,,,"As far back as the industrial revolution, significant development in technical innovation has succeeded in transforming numerous manual tasks and processes that had been in existence for decades where humans had reached the limits of physical capacity. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers this same transformative potential for the augmentation and potential replacement of human tasks and activities within a wide range of industrial, intellectual and social applications. The pace of change for this new AI technological age is staggering, with new breakthroughs in algorithmic machine learning and autonomous decision-making, engendering new opportunities for continued innovation. The impact of AI could be significant, with industries ranging from: finance, healthcare, manufacturing, retail, supply chain, logistics and utilities, all potentially disrupted by the onset of AI technologies. The study brings together the collective insight from a number of leading expert contributors to highlight the significant opportunities, realistic assessment of impact, challenges and potential research agenda posed by the rapid emergence of AI within a number of domains: business and management, government, public sector, and science and technology. This research offers significant and timely insight to AI technology and its impact on the future of industry and society in general, whilst recognising the societal and industrial influence on pace and direction of AI development."
,,,"As supply chain management is becoming demand driven, logistics service providers need to use real-time information efficiently and integrate new technologies into their business. Synchromodal logistics has emerged recently to improve flexibility in supply chains, cooperation among stakeholders, and utilization of resources. We survey the existing scientific literature and real-life developments on synchromodality. We focus on the critical success factors of synchromodality and six categories of enabling technologies. We identify open research issues and propose the introduction of a new stakeholder, which takes on the role of orchestrator to coordinate and provide services through a technology-based platform."
,,,"This chapter focuses on the peer-to-peer (P2P) markets that create and facilitate trade between large numbers of fragmented buyers and sellers on the electricity markets that form the smart grids. Recent changes and innovations on these markets are leading to a transformation from traditional energy consumers to proactive prosumers. This shift of a traditional role attributed to the economic agents operating on the markets for electrical energy is causing considerable social impacts that would shape up the future of the smart grids and energy market design. Moreover, the chapter investigates the raising popularity of sharing economy, a paradigm that allowed the development of P2P platform markets in energy industry and investigates the societal impacts they may induce with respect to the smart grids and their perception both by the conventional energy customers and modern-day prosumers."

,,,"Cross-border e-commerce is becoming increasingly popular around the world. With the development of technology, competition has gradually shifted from commodity-based attributes, such as cost and quality, to a supply chain's service capacity for e-commerce. Within this context, the present paper delineates how cross-border e-commerce firms can generate supply chain service capabilities that yield improvements in supply chain relationship quality to e-tailors and other platform users. Insights are derived through data collected via a multiple case study approach based on four Chinese cross-border e-commerce enterprises (OSell, Zongteng, BizArk and Linca); data were collected from 41 semi-structured interviews, field visits and secondary data. Relying on the service-dominant logic as the theoretical foundation, we identify three supply chain resources (flows related to information, logistics and finance) and their interplay as being critical for the development of supply chain service capabilities, which in turn lead to an improvement in the quality of supply chain relationships (assessed by the dimensions of trust improvement/commitment, risk mitigation, and customer satisfaction). The results offer important insights into how to best manage supply chain resources in relation to the three flows by cross-border e-commerce firms in order to foster relationship quality, an attribute that has become so critical today for competitive differentiation."
,,,"This chapter examines how FinTech is breaking barriers to financial inclusion. It first traces the history of FinTech and its evolution both globally and in Africa. Then it reviews the impact of selected FinTech products in African countries. Several observations are noteworthy. First, mobile money facilitated by mobile technology stands out as the most successful innovation in extending financial inclusion in Africa. Second, the most promising innovation that has the potential to alleviate SME funding constraints is crowdfunding. However, this potential can only be realized by increasing internet access in Africa, the region with the lowest penetration. Finally, the chapter discusses the challenges facing the proliferation of FinTech investments in Africa."
,,,"Industry 4.0 is expected to impart profound changes to the configuration of manufacturing companies with regards to what their value proposition will be and how their production network, supplier base and customer interfaces will develop. The literature on the topic is still fragmented; the features of the emerging paradigm appear to be a contested territory among different academic disciplines. This study assumes a value chain perspective to analyze the evolutionary trajectories of manufacturing companies. We developed a Delphi-based scenario analysis involving 76 experts from academia and practice. The results highlight the most common expectations as well as controversial issues in terms of emerging business models, size, barriers to entry, vertical integration, rent distribution, and geographical location of activities. Eight scenarios provide a concise outlook on the range of possible futures. These scenarios are based on four main drivers which stem from the expertsâ€™ comments: demand characteristics, transparency of data among value chain participants, maturity of additive manufacturing and advanced robotics, and penetration of smart products. Researchers can derive from our study a series of hypotheses and opportunities for future research on Industry 4.0. Managers and policymakers can leverage the scenarios in long-term strategic planning."
,,,"Cyberâ€“physical systems (CPSs) are the next generation of engineering systems, in which computing, communication and process control technologies are transparently integrated, constituting novel type of autonomous system. In these systems, embedded computers and networks monitor (through sensors) and control (through actuators) the physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes and computations affect each other. By equipping physical objects with interfaces to the virtual world, and by incorporating intelligent mechanisms to leverage collaboration between these objects, the boundaries between the physical and virtual realms become blurred. Interactions occurring in the physical world can change the processing behavior in the virtual world, in a causal relationship that can be exploited for the constant improvement of processes. Intelligent, self-aware, self-managing and self-configuring pervasive systems can be built to improve quality of process in many important application domains such as transportation, energy, industrial and medical systems. The goal of this special issue is to report high-quality research on recent advances toward the realization of the Smart Cyberâ€“Physical Systems paradigm. By presenting a selection of papers on various topics related to Smart Cyberâ€“Physical Systems, we hope to shed light on the multiple aspects of this emerging paradigm. The papers included in this issue propose solutions for data processing and analysis, architecture, platforms and technology enablers, energy and security management, as well as its application to building smart and sustainable spaces."
,,,"Road transportation being a leading source of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, is now resulting a move away from the traditional internal combustion engine to electric vehicles (EVs), currently powered by battery technology. This paper examines end-of-first-life applications of EVs batteries in a low-carbon circular economy following global transition to EVs and net zero economy. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key actors within the EV industry in the UK. Drawing on Stahel closed-loop solutions, a qualitative analysis of the transcripts of these interviews revealed the need for business models towards coherent low-carbon circular economy of the value chains. This paper reveals a whole range of issues relating to: extraction of battery critical raw minerals (e.g. ethical concerns); manufacturing (e.g. lack of policy frameworks addressing value chain emissions); distribution and sale (e.g. gaps in circular built economy strategy and transition plan); use (e.g. lack of a functioning market for end-of-first-life batteries) as well as research and innovation (e.g. lack of infrastructure to deal with end-of-first-life cells). The views on policy weaknesses testifies to the need for close-loop business model to not only focus on recycling battery raw minerals or repurposing battery for energy storage applications. But, should consider many aspects of an innovative policy strategy and productâ€™s global value chain, accounting for: equitable jobs, critical raw minerals dependency, circularity governance and industry standards, protecting the natural environment, tackling emissions and ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns. The study highlights establishing key trade-offs within policy goals considering the global value chains, as well as, harnessing synergies between social, economic and environmental goals. The paper concludes that a low-carbon close-loop business model should integrate the triple objectives of making positive impact on people, planet and profit, and developed on the basis of legislation, collaboration, research, investment, and incentives guiding to achieve the Global Goals."
,,,"One of the main global challenges in the last few years has been to improve energy efficiency. In this area, the residential sector is responsible for a considerable proportion of energy consumption and a possible way to address this problem is to adopt a HAS (Home Automation System). This work reports the results of our investigation in smart home systems that combine WSANs (Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks) and Computational Intelligence techniques with a focus on energy efficiency. We discuss several valuable ideas from this systematic review, including guidelines for new research projects in the area of home automation. As result of this survey, the main contributions of this work are: (i) identification and discussion of studies that combine WSANs and computation intelligence in HAS that particularly target energy-saving; (ii) finding gaps in the selected works, and offering solutions that can guide new areas of research, as well as new projects in HAS and (iii) demonstrating that solutions based on WSANs that are integrated with computational intelligence have emerged as an attractive alternative that can be deployed in a HAS."
,,,"There are many indications that the electric power sector is on the verge of a digital revolution, which can facilitate a more integrated, highly flexible, and customer-centric energy system. Rather than the incremental cost-cutting efficiency measures characteristic of digitalization efforts to date, the next wave of change will be driven by data-savvy organizations that are able to establish direct relationships with consumers, resulting in the provision of new services with new revenue streams. Many offerings focus on the intelligent management of demand and supply from electrified buildings and vehicles, which is leading to a proliferation of new business models."
,,,"A successful Peer-to-Peer (P2P) electricity trading within a microgrid requires a P2P electricity trading price and strategy that enable both energy prosumers and consumers to obtain profits. Therefore, this study aims to propose a P2P electricity trading strategy based on the minimum and maximum electricity trading prices for energy prosumers and consumers that ensure their profitability, by considering the actual electricity market structure in South Korea. Towards this end, the minimum and maximum electricity trading prices for energy prosumers and consumers were calculated based on the market participation conditions and electricity trading scenarios established in this study. By matching energy prosumers and consumers based on the calculated minimum and maximum electricity trading prices, a P2P electricity trading strategy was ultimately proposed. As a result, the minimum (i.e., US$0.05â€“0.34/kWh) and maximum (i.e., US$0.09â€“0.32/kWh) electricity trading prices increased as the monthly electricity consumption of energy prosumers and consumers increased and the self-consumption and electricity purchase rates decreased. Consequently, the profitable electricity trading scenarios increased as the monthly electricity consumption was lower and the self-consumption rate was higher for energy prosumers, and as the monthly electricity consumption was higher and the electricity purchase rate was lower for energy consumers. In particular, the P2P electricity trading can provide maximum profits to energy prosumers and consumers when the monthly electricity consumption of energy prosumers is 200Â kWh, the monthly electricity consumption of energy consumers is 500Â kWh, and the electricity purchase rate is 20%. Based on the findings of this study, it is possible not only to determine profitable P2P electricity trading prices to market participants but also to establish an optimal P2P electricity trading strategy by matching energy prosumers and consumers that can ensure them with maximum profits."
,,,"Social innovation (SI) offers a sustainable solution to prevalent social issues/problems and is typically developed and deployed by a varied set of people from the society adopting a top-down and/or bottom-up approach. The disruption of new-age technologies (NATs) is immensely impacting the space of SIs, providing a resource-efficient solution, and bringing multiple outcome benefits. In this study, we discuss the SIs driven by new-age technologies and attempt to address a few critical questions around such SIs to better understand the construct, such as â€“ What is SI? How are NATs playing a role in providing an innovative offering for the social good? Where does it take place in society? How can SI be deployed in society to reach out to the populace? and, Why SI is required for society? By employing the triangulation approach, we provide a comprehensive framework recognizing the different contexts under which SI takes place in society, explaining the possible outcomes and suggesting the boundary conditions. We then provide the generalized propositions on the proposed relationship in the SI framework. Further, this study identifies directions for future research and provides implications for firms, policymakers, and social entrepreneurs."
,,,"Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) envisions a network of medical devices and people, which use wireless communication to enable the exchange of healthcare data. Healthcare costs and prices for services have been increasing with the growing population and the use of advanced technology. The combination of IoMT and healthcare can improve the quality of life, provide better care services and can create more cost-effective systems. This paper introduces the status of IoMT for healthcare industry, including research and development plans and applications. The implementation of theÂ IoMTÂ in healthcareÂ has exponentially increased across the world, but still, it has many technical and design challenges. This paper depicts such challenges and shows a generic IoMT framework that consists of three main components, data acquisition, communication gateways, and servers/cloud, to meet the aforementioned challenges. Finally, this paper discusses the opportunities and prospects of IoMT in practice while emphasizing the corresponding open research issues."
,,,"The fourth industrial revolution, also labelled Industry 4.0, was beget with emergent and disruptive intelligence and information technologies. These new technologies are enabling ever-higher levels of production efficiencies. They also have the potential to dramatically influence social and environmental sustainable development. Organizations need to consider Industry 4.0 technologies contribution to sustainability. Sufficient guidance, in this respect, is lacking in the scholarly or practitioner literature. In this study, we further examine Industry 4.0 technologies in terms of application and sustainability implications. We introduce a measures framework for sustainability based on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals; incorporating various economic, environmental and social attributes. We also develop a hybrid multi-situation decision method integrating hesitant fuzzy set, cumulative prospect theory and VIKOR. This method can effectively evaluate Industry 4.0 technologies based on their sustainable performance and application. We apply the method using secondary case information from a report of the World Economic Forum. The results show that mobile technology has the greatest impact on sustainability in all industries, and nanotechnology, mobile technology, simulation and drones have the highest impact on sustainability in the automotive, electronics, food and beverage, and textile, apparel and footwear industries, respectively. Our recommendation is to take advantage of Industry 4.0 technology adoption to improve sustainability impact but each technology needs to be carefully evaluated as specific technology will variably influence industry and sustainability dimensions. Investment in such technologies should consider appropriate priority investment and championing."
,,,"Globalization of food value chains has increased the demand for greater transparency over where food is produced, how, by whom and with what effect on society and the environment. A range of new digital technologies are available to facilitate transparency, with the promise of leading the global food system to an era of â€˜hyper-transparencyâ€™. Its impact on smallholder farmer inclusion, however, remains questionable. The potential benefits of hyper-transparency for smallholders are improved access to services and markets. Thus far, important challenges remain. These are limited access to these technologies for smallholders and new power relations that emerge around access, use and control of data."
,,,"Global warming is a hot topic of climate change, and its negative impact on oceans, ecology, and human health has become an indisputable fact. As a major cause of global warming, carbon dioxide emissions forecasting has attracted increasingly attention. However, previous studies only focused on forecasting accuracy and neglected stability. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel hybrid algorithm, which combines lion swarm optimizer and genetic algorithm to optimize the traditional least squares support vector machine model. The carbon dioxide emissions data of developed countries, developing countries and the world from 1965 to 2017 are taken as the research objects. The performance test of the new algorithm shows that it has higher stability and accuracy. In addition, the forecasting results of the new algorithm are compared with the other eight algorithms, it shows that the novel hybrid algorithm has stronger global optimization ability, faster convergence speed, and higher accuracy, and has a medium calculation speed. Regarding the forecast of carbon dioxide emissions, compared with other five models (such as back-propagation neural network and least squares support vector machine), the mean absolute error of the new model (in the test set) decreased by 30.68â€“163.35â€¯MT, and the mean absolute percentage error decreased by 0.726%â€“1.878%. Finally, the new model is utilized to forecast carbon dioxide emissions in various countries from 2018 to 2025."
,,,"Digitization makes it easier for firms to build their innovation and marketing efforts around consumers' personal data. In this research, we employ a privacy perspective based on contextual integrity to examine how such practices can trigger privacy concerns. We propose that small entrepreneurial firms are often at a particular disadvantage compared to large incumbent firms. At the same time, we also highlight that there are several strategies firms can use to mitigate privacy concerns and that in some circumstances, privacy concerns may also exert positive effects on data-driven marketing by stimulating privacy innovation and providing a source of competitive advantage."
,,,"In this chapter, the authors examine the Bitcoin protocol and its innovation. Their conclusion is that Bitcoin's role as a system providing financial services may have been grossly underestimated, and bitcoin's role as an alternative to fiat currencies is likely to fail. This chapter discusses the Bitcoin key engineering elements that offer the possibility of a radically different approach for architecting electronic payment systems among other more sophisticated system such as crowd sales, crowd funding, peer-to-peer exchanges, and other side-chain capabilities. The technologies embedded within the Bitcoin system that have the potential to develop into very open, contestable, and interconnected ecosystems for the delivery of new and existing form of financial services will also be described."
,,,"Global humanitarian initiatives are calling for technologies to bridge the urban-rural divide in support of remote community electrification projects through micro-utility programs. Distributed off-grid renewable generation has the ability to supply energy to remote communities while smart microgrids are able to effectively integrate intermittent renewable resources through management procedures that improve reliability, resiliency and sustainability. Microgrid control systems are typified by a hierarchical nature with multi-layered functionalities and capabilities to ensure optimized operations through strategic energy management and power flow balancing. This paper considers transactive energy management principles for supply/demand coordination and demonstrates that the concept is effective in managing energy demand response and data flow dynamics in the context of rural community-based energy systems. A transactive energy management system is modeled for rural village DC microgrids, and evaluated through demonstrative computer simulations. It shows how smart microgrid load control switching on homogeneous load groups is commanded through microgrid economic value signals that are adjustable by home owners to meet village and household energy budget constraints. The proposed approach is novel in that it offers a low complexity coordination framework, based on market principles, and demand response mechanisms for multi-priority grouping control of non-intelligent devices in off-grid rural village settings."

,,,"COVID-19 has radically transformed many aspects of human life and global society both now and for many years to come. A key aspect of the transformation has been increased digitalization and the accelerated implementation of previously predicted trends that have been discussed for many years in the information management literature. Human endeavour has encouraged us to adapt to the â€œnew normalâ€ through immediate necessity in areas such as work, education, healthcare, entertainment and leisure, and online commerce. This new environment has provided unprecedented opportunities for the information management research community to develop research that will have a significant impact on practice in these and other areas. We are essentially at the pinnacle of new developments in the digital space and must seek to develop exemplars that can help to signpost the future direction of digital global society for the benefit of all. Notwithstanding, the problems of digitalization have also been exacerbated and must be further understood and ameliorated in the post-COVID world. This paper examines opportunities and problems in information management brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. It details implications for research and practice."
,,,"This article points at insights from the subfields of international business and strategic management that are relevant for sustainability transitions research. Specifically, building on the emergent â€˜mainstreamâ€™ literature on â€˜genericâ€™ digital platforms, we explain how a range of digital platform multinationals has emerged which address sustainability challenges, and highlight their potential for accelerating multi-sector transitions across geographies. The article does not cover contested platforms such as AirBnB and Uber, but focuses on sustainability-oriented digital platform multinationals (SO-DPMs), which directly tackle social and/or environmental issues by enabling new linkages between individuals and/or organizations. These SO-DPMs deserve more research attention because of their ability to affect sustainability transitions in their own (home) and foreign (host) countries, and realize interconnections and replication across borders. Besides explicating their relevance for sustainability transitions research, we propose promising areas for investigation, considering SO-DPMs, actors in their networks, and society more broadly."
,,,"The SDGs are intended to address sustainable development processes in both developed and developing countries, and to facilitate action at all levels and with all actors, including government, civil society, the private sector and the science community. The SDG 14 covers, among other features, economic pressures on the marine environment and takes into account the specificities of coastal communities. This paper reviews the rational for the SDG 14, as well as the framework for the SDG 14 indicators including (i) some basic concepts such as the role of uncertainty, irreversibility and thresholds in the marine context, and the multidimensionality of the indicators; (ii) synergies and trade-offs among the SDG 14 targets, and between SDG 14 and other SDGs targets, and how to track progress on policy coherence at the national level; (iii) synergies between SDG 14 indicators, and Millennium Development Goalsâ€™ and Multilateral Environmental Agreementsâ€™ targets and indicators; and (iv) the role of big data. Indicators at the global and national scales (France) are also explored. To conclude, there are challenges and opportunities for future research in this area such as the development of indicators building on the frontiers of ocean science, the development of innovative approaches for data collection, the development of common approaches in valuing marine ecosystem services and national accounting, the provision of incentives for best practice and peer-learning, the harmonisation of measurement methodologies and the selection of SDG 14 indicators according to the geographical level of intervention."
,,,"Establishing food security remains a global challenge; it is thus a specific objective of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. Successfully delivering productive and sustainable agricultural systems worldwide will form the foundations for overcoming this challenge. Smart agriculture is often perceived as one key enabler when considering the twin objectives of eliminating world hunger and undernourishment. The practical realization, deployment, and adoption of smart agricultural systems remain distant due to a confluence of technological, social, and economic factors. Edge computing offers a potentially tractable model for mainstreaming smart agriculture. A synergistic relationship exists, which, if harnessed productively, would increase the penetration of smart agricultural technologies across Majority-Minority world boundaries. The paper considers the prevailing context of global food security, smart agriculture and the pervasive issue of internet access. A survey of the state-of-the-art in research utilizing the Edge model of computing in agriculture is reported. Results of the survey confirm that the Edge model is actively explored in a number of agricultural domains. However, research is rooted in the prototype stage, and detailed studies are currently lacking. While potential is demonstrated, several systemic challenges must be addressed to manifest meaningful impact at the farm level."
,,,"There is no doubt that the world will need more food in the future, as demand is driven by a growing population and rising incomes. However, this increase in food demand will be constrained by scarcer resources, more attention to food security, and changing dietary habits. Today, the most effective way to increase the amount of food produced is through efficiency gains, as clearing new land for agricultural activities stopped being sustainable a long time ago. The obvious and most effective way to gain efficiencies is to reduce the amount of food that is produced but not consumed. Food losses may happen before or after the retail point, and these are distinguished by calling the former food loss and the latter food waste. Although the problems related to food waste are just as severe as those related to food loss and there have been considerable efforts to reduce food waste, the success of these initiatives relies to a great extent on public awareness and policies aimed at changing consumer behavior. By contrast, avoiding food loss is more amenable to the use of quantitative techniques and digital technology, and for this reason, the discussion in this chapter will be mostly focused on food loss, although our review provides pointers to causes and current progress in food waste prevention. In this chapter, we review the potential impact of some new digital technologies, including quantitative logistic optimization models, to avoid food loss: we explain the importance of having good quality data, discuss methodologies to obtain and validate the data, and briefly review new technologies like the Internet of Things to obtain data updates in real time. After the review, we present a case study of a vegetable supply chain to illustrate the usefulness of the approach, and end with a summary of new technologies to reduce food loss."
,,,"Smart cities functions have been represented in the form of a metaphorical mandala co-opted to serve as an abstract simplification for the public to understand the complexities of smart cities, as well as to compartmentalize the principal functions as discrete facets of the operating system architecture. These six smart functions - Mobility, Environment, People, Governance, Economy and Living - serve their own purpose within the urban framework while simultaneously supporting the collective operations of the city, and over time will develop new typologies and sub-functions as dynamic, transforming systems. In order to explore these functions as part of the evolutionary development of cities, the Multi-Level Perspective model (MLP) has been applied to map diverse urban scenarios as they transition in terms of past (Evolution), present (Challenges) and future (Directions). Since each city's progression is determined by its unique city DNA profile, each smart city function is modeled by describing and visualizing this progression. In parallel, to support the theory and application of convergence, the inter-relationship of human, technological and natural systems is explored along the dimensions of Object, Action and Outcome to articulate the key variables that influence the trajectory of each smart city's distinct technological evolution and transformation."
,,,"While most of the debates about cryptocurrencies are centered on the global Bitcoin market, in this article, we focus on local Bitcoin trading volume in 21 emerging countries. In particular, we attempt to determine the drivers of Bitcoin trading volume in these countries over the period August 1st, 2015 â€“ June 2nd, 2018. Based on VECM and ARDL models, we find evidence of significant relationship between the local Bitcoin trading volume in each country and the associated banking system access, especially in the short-run. Moreover, altcoins (Ethereum, Ripple) prices are shown to affect positively and significantly the local Bitcoin trading volume for most countries in the long-run (VECM results) and the short-run (ARDL results)."
,,,"Port Community Systems (PCS) are inter-organizational software platforms that connects port community actors, enabling commercial services and information exchange between the port to their customers and a variety of stakeholders. Our main motivation for this paper lies in the absence of surveys on the PCS literature, hence the purpose of this paper is to perform a structured literature review on PCS to establish promising research gaps. Such review was conducted surveying the literature about PCS from 2001 until 2019. The study introduces a detailed and current worldwide PCS inventory using a proposed evolution framework and a taxonomy, the latter built upon commonly cited factors from the IT systems development literature in the context of port communities, which are synthesized into three frames: a Business frame, an Integration frame, and a Legal frame. Findings show that literature on PCS is scarce and fragmented, oftentimes with PCS research published in non-specialized documents on the topic, with few comparative studies between countries and several countries receiving little attention. Few authors have high specialization on the topic while most authors in average contribute less than once to the body of knowledge. Additionally, it was found that industry is ahead of scientific research in terms of documenting PCS development and technical features. The results also show a lack of innovation regarding PCS research studies, which risks relegating PCS research to irrelevance. A major critique to extant PCS literature is about its inertia, as research tends to be excessively comfortable with the legacy PCS, neglecting its need to evolve and adapt to new markets (in response to the growth of emerging economies) or to extended functionalities (taking advantage of the surge of new technologies). Furthermore, it was found that the future of PCS research should aim for addressing practical needs, while fostering collaboration among practitioners and scholars."
,,,"This paper joins discussions about Bitcoin's relationship to investments in developed and emerging markets. Our study contributes to the ongoing discussion of the role of Bitcoin for investors. In our research, we analyse relationships on financial markets with Bitcoin user graph characteristics. We examine the relationships between Bitcoin rates of return, stock indices, and variables characterising Bitcoin users who carried out the largest number of Bitcoin buy and sell transactions and users who carried out transactions with the highest amounts. We mainly focus on the problem whether the Bitcoin rate of return is mostly driven by capital market situation or major Bitcoin users behaviour. Our results confirmed that there is not, in general, significant relationship between financial market situation (if such relationship does exist, it is found in emerging markets). However, our findings indicate a significant impact of the behaviour of major Bitcoin users on Bitcoin rate of return."

,,,"The many scholars approaching Industry 4.0 today need to confront the lack of an agreed-upon definition, posing serious limitations to theory building and research comparability. Since its initial German conceptualization in 2011, both the technological landscape and the understanding of the Industry 4.0 have evolved significantly leading to several ambiguities. In parallel, similar concepts often used as synonymsÂ âˆ’Â such as â€œsmart manufacturingâ€, â€œdigital transformationâ€, and â€œfourth industrial revolutionâ€Â âˆ’Â have increased the sense of confusion around the scope and characteristics of the phenomenon. This study approaches the issue through an analysis of almost 100 definitions of Industry 4.0 and related concepts. The review of academic publications has been complemented by a selection of the most influential non-academic sources, including governmental bodies and consulting companies. Each definition has been broken down into its underlying technological and non-technological definitional elements. This categorization will serve as a basis for future research to approach the phenomenon in its multiple facets."

The potential for improving people's lives through financial inclusion is enormous, and many of the gains are already being realized. There are risks as well, though, and making the most of these opportunities will require skillful regulation. At the moment, regulators and policymakers alike are struggling to keep up."
,,,"The literature is populated with definitions of logistics and supply chain management. It is important to note from the outset that one of the activities of supply chain management is logistics. The Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals (2014) states that â€œlogistics is that part of the Supply Chain Management that plans, implements, and controls the efficient, effective forward and reverse flow and storage of goods, services, and related information between point of origin and point of consumption in order to meet customersâ€™ requirements.â€ Christopher (2011) defines logistics as â€œthe process of strategically managing the procurement, movement and storage of goods.â€ Within the supply chain, any decision of one activity will inevitably spread up and downstream, and the interaction among activities is not always positive. In fact, gains in one activity may result in loss in another one. This chapter provides a global overview of the forces that influence freight transport sector. The discussion of key drivers and trends in logistics and supply chain management will follow the STEEP approach. The STEEP approach is a known technique used in marketing and business analysis to evaluate various external factors that impact an organization or sector."
,,,"Policy initiatives towards reduction of CO2 emissions implemented so far are grounded on the so-called Production-Based paradigm: this approach allocates responsibility of emissions to countries that directly caused such emissions, without taking into account all the indirect contributions to CO2 emissions caused outside countryâ€™s borders, eventually leading to the so-called carbon leakage phenomenon. In this paper, the alternative Consumption-Based approach is proposed, and its effectiveness assessed: according to this approach, policy initiatives allocates responsibility for CO2 emissions proportionally to the CO2 emissions embedded in goods and services required by industries as inputs for production. Global environmental and economic consequences of carbon emissions reduction policies, applied at the European level based on both Production- and Consumption-Based paradigms, are comparatively assessed based on the World Trade Model with Bilateral Trades. Results of this study suggest that defining CO2 emissions policies based on a Consumption-Based paradigm seems to be the most effective way to reduce the global carbon emissions, avoiding the carbon leakage phenomenon which may occur in economies regulated by Production-Based policies. Indeed, an imposed reduction in CO2 emissions embedded in EU final demand through a Consumption-Based Accounting policy would result in a global CO2 emissions reduction up to almost 1.2 Gton. On the other hand, an imposed reduction in direct EU CO2 emissions according to a PBA approach would result in an overall increase in global carbon emissions up to almost 0.8 Gton."
,,,"The integration of innovation within healthcare is a key aspect of the so-called next generation medical systems. Toward this direction the contribution of this volume is multifold. First demystifies the new wave of emerging and streamline technologies and uncovers the added value of their components. Second underlines a new policy-based era of health governance, since the integration of innovation within healthcare must be understood from the key stakeholders and needs to be implemented taking into account various limitations. Last but not least, innovation in healthcare must be seen as a human-centric process where complicated and sophisticated, distributed medical services and processes are utilized. The adoption of advanced Healthcare Information Systems and Medical Informatics requires an integrated approach sensitive to various social, economic, political, and cultural factors. The challenges that the adoption and use sophisticated information and communication technologies (ICTs) generate need to be considered too. Smart Data and Data Analytics along with cognitive computing are the promising technologies with great value added for the domain of healthcare. The focus of this edited volume is to examine the social, economic, political, and cultural impacts, and challenges emerging sophisticated ICT bear for patient-centric systems in healthcare. By offering a detailed comprehensive and comparative insight into diverse advances in ICT and their application across issues and domains, this edited volume occupies a unique position on the market. This is because it brings together not only a discussion on the most promising technologies and their current and prospective uses, but also dwells on managerial and policymaking challenges and opportunities this process creates."
,,,"This paper analyses the monetary characteristics of five cryptocurrencies to evaluate whether they can perform the functions of money. While all cryptocurrencies can theoretically and practically serve as a medium of exchange, they are unlikely to become common and liquid media of exchange unless they can illustrate utility in one of the other functions of money. Digital currenciesâ€™ rigidly inflexible supply and wildly fluctuating demand make them too unstable to be used as a unit of account for the foreseeable future. Of the five, only Bitcoin has the potential to serve as a store of value, due to its strict commitment to low supply growth, credibly backed by the networkâ€™s distributed protocol and credible demonstration of the absence of any authority capable of altering the supply schedule. Other cryptocurrenciesâ€™ centralized control, and use as tokens for specific applications make them unlikely to fulfil monetary functions."
,,,"Presidential elections can impact world peace, global economics, and overall well-being. Recent news indicates that fraud on the Web has played a substantial role in elections, particularly in developing countries in South America and the public discourse, in general. To protect the trustworthiness of the Web, in this paper, we present a novel framework using statistical techniques to help detect veiled Web fraud attacks in Online Social Networks (OSN). Specific examples are used to demonstrate how some statistical techniques, such as the Kalman Filter and the modified CUSUM, can be applied to detect various attack scenarios. A hybrid data set, consisting of both real user tweets collected from Twitter and simulated fake tweets is constructed for testing purposes. The efficacy of the proposed framework has been verified by computing metrics, such as Precision, Recall, and Area Under the ROC curve. The algorithms achieved up to 99.9% accuracy in some scenarios and are over 80% accurate for most of the other scenarios."
,,,"Cities are increasingly turning towards specialized technologies to address issues related to society, ecology, morphology and many others. The emerging concept of Smart Cities highly encourages this prospect by promoting the incorporation of sensors and Big Data through the Internet of Things (IoT). This surge of data brings new possibilities in the design and management of cities just as much as economic prospects. While Big Data processing through Artificial Intelligence (AI) can greatly contribute to the urban fabric, sustainability and liveability dimensions however must not be overlooked in favour of technological ones. This paper reviews the urban potential of AI and proposes a new framework binding AI technology and cities while ensuring the integration of key dimensions of Culture, Metabolism and Governance; which are known to be primordial in the successful integration of Smart Cities for the compliance to the Sustainable Development Goal 11 and the New Urban Agenda. This paper is aimed towards Policy Makers, Data Scientists and Engineers who are looking at enhancing the integration of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data in Smart Cities with an aim to increase the liveability of the urban fabric while boosting economic growth and opportunities."

As everyone prepares for a new era in Digital Banking and Internet Finance, now is a uniquely opportune moment to harness the power of innovation for an undisputed good: Financial Inclusion. Starting with M-PESA in Kenya, innovations in financial inclusion have been instrumental in bringing financial services to those that need it the most. At this moment, fintech innovation and financial inclusion are meeting in an unlikely place: Myanmar. After emerging from decades of isolation and economic mismanagement under military rule, Myanmar now has the fastest growing economy in Southeast Asia, and, uniquely, the 52 million people that live in the country are gaining access to the latest technology for the first time. At this exciting point in Myanmar's history, there is an opportunity for true digital leapfrogging for financial inclusion. This chapter gives a detailed picture of Myanmar amid its unprecedented transformation, and a seminal call for the innovators of the world in fintech and digital banking to consider Myanmar the next financial inclusion frontier."
,,,"Supply chain management seeks efficiency. Inefficiencies cause various types of waste and commensurate costs. Supply chain actors differ resulting in proximity issues. Proximity is introduced here as distances on four dimensions; organizational, geographical, cognitive and technological proximity. Industry 4.0 concepts can improve or even worsen each of the introduced proximity dimensions their influence on green supply chains. We propose a need for investigation at the nexus of Industry 4.0 and greening supply chains; proximity analysis provides a vehicle for this investigation."
,,,"Natural nanomaterials are abundant in the environment and even though the inhabitants of ancient civilizations in Rome, Greece, China, India, etc. used to know the techniques to exploit and apply some of the nanoparticles in different products to achieve different purposes, the deliberate and purposeful use of engineered nanomaterials in different consumer and industrial products is more likely a craze of the 21st century. With the active participation of stakeholders from different disciplines, countries across the world have joined the race to take the lead of the trillion-dollar market of the engineered nanomaterials after the enactment of the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act 2003 by the United States of America. More than hundred countries around the world have specific program of nanotechnologies research and development. Nevertheless, due to the exceptional and strange of the engineered particles at the nanoscale, there arise some legal and regulatory concerns that some of the nanomaterials have adverse effects on the environment and human health, even though there are still scopes to draw the final conclusion. This Chapter intends to cover, review and evaluate the existing international legal and regulatory developments in this regard. Some of the possible challenges faced by the regulators in terms of implementing relevant legal provisions will also be examined. The chapter will further share how the international and municipal community have been working to overcome these challenges."
,,,"Agriculture 4.0 is comprised of different already operational or developing technologies such as robotics, nanotechnology, synthetic protein, cellular agriculture, gene editing technology, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and machine learning, which may have pervasive effects on future agriculture and food systems and major transformative potential. These technologies underpin conÂ­ceptsÂ suchÂ asÂ verÂ­tiÂ­calÂ farmÂ­ing and food systems,Â digÂ­iÂ­talÂ agriÂ­culÂ­ture,Â bioeÂ­conÂ­omy,Â cirÂ­cuÂ­larÂ agriÂ­culÂ­ture,Â andÂ aquaponÂ­ics. In this perspective paper, we argue that more attention is needed for the inclusion and exclusion effects of Agriculture 4.0 technologies, and for reflection on how they relate to diverse transition pathways towards sustainable agricultural and food systems driven by mission-oriented innovation systems. This would require processes of responsible innovation, anticipating the potential impacts of Agriculture 4.0 through inclusive processes, and reflecting on and being responsive to emerging effects and where needed adjusting the direction and course of transition pathways."
,,,"Inadequate utilization of available food resources constitutes a major problem regarding the growing population, the increased demand for food and the current need to reduce the global footprint exerted on the planet. Understanding value chains, identifying pressure points and room for improvement using new technological solutions, are important steps to enhance raw material utilization for the individual industries. Marine resources generated from the fish industry is an important part of the Norwegian food production and contributes about 4% to mainland gross domestic product. The most important industries are Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture, and wild capture of pelagic fish, cod (Gadus morhua) and saithe (Pollachius virens). Processing to saleable products, mainly fillets, generates large amounts of marine rest raw material. Logistics of aquaculture production and processing allow for close to 100% utilization, while only 44% of the white fish rest raw material is being utilized. Farming of fish close to shore enable processing of rest raw material immediately after slaughter, which is paramount to avoid deterioration. Cod and Saithe are mainly caught at sea by sea trawlers and the coastal fleet, with on-board handling and transportation to shore being hurdles to overcome for processing of rest raw material to high quality products for human consumption and animal feed. This review will focus on the value chain of the white fish industry in Norway, its history, current status and possibilities of improvement to better utilize rest raw material."
,,,"There is a steady global trend towards â€œData Localization,â€ laws by which data is required to be maintained and processed within the geographic boundaries of its state of origin. This development has raised concerns about its possible adverse impacts on emerging data-intensive technologies such as Cloud services/E-commerce, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things (collectively, the Embedded Infosphere). The inability to reach an international agreement on rules for cross-border data flows may have significant adverse consequences for all future users of the Internet. The basis of Data Localization is grounded in two distinct but inter-related policy models: Data Sovereignty and Trans-Border Data Flows. These two concepts have different origins. â€œData Sovereigntyâ€ is derived from the historic power of a state of absolute and exclusive control within its geographic borders. Policies behind TBDFs arose in Europe following World War II, primarily motivated by Nazi use of early proto-computers to help round up Jews and others. As they have evolved, TBDF policies have been directed primarily at protecting personal data and privacy. This article first examines the issues of: 1) â€œInformation Sovereigntyâ€ and 2) TBDFs. It then describes the arguments for and against â€œData Localization,â€ offers some examples of strong localization policies (Russia, China), and summarizes contesting policy proposals. It then contextualizes TBDF with issues of human rights (free flow of information) and privacy. While the utility of an international agreement on TBDFs is clear, the differences in approaches are tenacious. For the free-market developed world (e.g, EU, OECD), the path forward seems to lead through policy convergence to compatible rules, with differentiated levels of data protection and accountability. It is far from clear whether these rules will address, in a mandatory way, issues of the â€œfree flowâ€ of information in the human rights sense. At the same time, there are countries (e.g., BRICS), representing a majority of the world's population, in which political and cultural resistance will produce stringent Cyber Sovereignty and Data Localization policies with few if any human rights components. The article concludes that the more the Internet is â€œlocalizedâ€, the more attenuated its benefits will become. The negative consequences of Data Localization will become increasingly obvious as new, data-intensive technologies become ubiquitous, creating a condition of â€œData Dependenceâ€. It is projected that in the future the nations with the least amount of Data Localization and the most open flow of information will be the most successful in benefiting from new data-intensive embedded, networked technologies. This will most likely be characterized by values adopted as policies and practices in the EU."
,,,"Global attention focuses primarily on the benefits that new digital technologies can offer people across the world, especially on their contribution to economic growth. It has become increasingly evident, however, that these technologies have also been associated with a dramatic increase in inequalities at every scale. While the rich and powerful can benefit from the latest technologies, the poorest and most marginalized, without access or the ability to use them, are left further behind. Those with disabilities, women and girls, street children, refugees, and those living in isolated areas can indeed all be empowered through such technologies, but only if explicit focus is placed on this agenda. Researchers have identified seven things necessary to turn back the tide of digital inequality: a refocusing of attention by governments, the private sector, and civil society on the poorest and most marginalized; technological innovation in the interests of, and with, the poorest; a rebalancing of power in the interests of elected governments rather than the private sector so that citizens can be more empowered; enhanced understanding of the role of effective partnerships; greater awareness of the dark side of digital technologies and security issues; greater systemic understanding and ethical interpretation across society of the potential uses of digital technologies; and realization that building the technologies is actually the easy part."
,,,"This chapter profoundly contextualises the emerging interplay between the process of diffusion of ICTs and, broadly defined, shifts in national welfare. It examines various aspects of the relationship of ICTs with social and economic development: why ICTs are treated as opportunity windows, why they are a prerequisite for socio-economic development, and how they can affect the performance of financial markets. It briefly discusses the channels through which growing access to and use of new ICTs can affect social, financial, and economic development of countries, and thus generate overall wealth."
,,,"The Internet really is now part of our social fabric and is essential to how we connect, communicate, share, and collaborate. Digital technologies, information and communication technologies, and broadband global connectivity when combined offer various opportunities to improve people's lives in worldwide societies by exchanging and sharing information. Some of the potential applications of broadband global connectivity include social connections, health, well-being and telemedicine, education, business and financial transaction, emergency response, and search and rescue These all are possible with Internet access and are discussed."
,,,"Big data analytics and artificial intelligence, paired with blockchain technology, the Internet of Things, and other emerging technologies, are poised to revolutionise urban management. With massive amounts of data collected from citizens, devices, and traditional sources such as routine and well-established censuses, urban areas across the world have â€“ for the first time in history â€“ the opportunity to monitor and manage their urban infrastructure in real-time. This simultaneously provides previously unimaginable opportunities to shape the future of cities, but also gives rise to new ethical challenges. This paper provides a transdisciplinary synthesis of the developments, opportunities, and challenges for urban management and planning under this ongoing â€˜digital revolutionâ€™ to provide a reference point for the largely fragmented research efforts and policy practice in this area. We consider both top-down systems engineering approaches and the bottom-up emergent approaches to coordination of different systems and functions, their implications for the existing physical and institutional constraints on the built environment and various planning practices, as well as the social and ethical considerations associated with this transformation from non-digital urban management to data-driven urban management."
,,,"Health is wealth. Thus, it is very important to keep it healthy all the time for sustenance of human livelihood. Last decade has witnessed a number of digital developments, including sensors, microcontrollers, communication paradigm, and smarter societal need. Internet of Things (IoT) has pushed the human race toward harnessing of truly digitized e-healthcare services mainly by relying over the biosensors. Biosensors play most crucial role in IoT when question of e-healthcare comes into the scene. A range of sensors are available in market that help people to monitor daily fitness, blood glucose level and many smart home-based diagnostics. However, lack of proper categorization of such sensors has led to create problems like delay in government approval, gap in patientâ€“doctorâ€‹ relationship, increased social inertia toward using the sensors in accordance to regular life style. To mitigate these issues, this work presents a systematic review on existing IoT-based sensors and IoT-market cap originated sensor-systems for taxonomically representation. We present comparative analysis among the reviewed sensors. We further present security and privacy issues associated with the sensor data and ways to mitigate them. We also discuss about futuristic plans to enhance current scenario. We further elaborate on how such intervention could be beneficial or problematic for society. We can conclude that IoT-based sensors upon certain fixation in terms of categorization and proper orientation can be very useful to make a smarter human society."
,,,"Rapid development in digital technology has brought a new phenomenon of industrial revolution, generally called by Industry 4.0. This revolution introduces modern technologies which support the connectivity of the entire components within the industries. However, connectivity is not the only advantage that will follow â€“ the concerns aim to support sustainability in industry. The United Nation Industrial Development Organization has set the relevancy of Industry 4.0 and sustainability in the global Sustainable Development Goals number 7 and 9 that digital industrial development will support the growth of industrial sustainable energy. Therefore, the implication will surely be affecting every country with different significance, including one of the emerging industry country, Indonesia. In response to that, Indonesia is currently framing the roadmap to enter Industry 4.0 era, Making Indonesia 4.0. Pioneering the academia research of Industry 4.0 in Indonesia, this research aims to figure out the systemic impact of Industry 4.0 technology development and implementation to sustainable energy transition in developing countries, which eventually needs a valid model conceptualization that acts as a standard for further researches. The output of this research is a model conceptual diagram, in a form of causal loop diagram, that would help a better understanding of variables that support the integration of Industry 4.0 and industrial sustainable energy in Indonesia."
,,,"While there is a lot of literature from a natural or technical sciences perspective on different forms of digitalization in agriculture (big data, internet of things, augmented reality, robotics, sensors, 3D printing, system integration, ubiquitous connectivity, artificial intelligence, digital twins, and blockchain among others), social science researchers have recently started investigating different aspects of digital agriculture in relation to farm production systems, value chains and food systems. This has led to a burgeoning but scattered social science body of literature. There is hence lack of overview of how this field of study is developing, and what are established, emerging, and new themes and topics. This is where this article aims to make a contribution, beyond introducing this special issue which presents seventeen articles dealing with social, economic and institutional dynamics of precision farming, digital agriculture, smart farming or agriculture 4.0. An exploratory literature review shows that five thematic clusters of extant social science literature on digitalization in agriculture can be identified: 1) Adoption, uses and adaptation of digital technologies on farm; 2) Effects of digitalization on farmer identity, farmer skills, and farm work; 3) Power, ownership, privacy and ethics in digitalizing agricultural production systems and value chains; 4) Digitalization and agricultural knowledge and innovation systems (AKIS); and 5) Economics and management of digitalized agricultural production systems and value chains. The main contributions of the special issue articles are mapped against these thematic clusters, revealing new insights on the link between digital agriculture and farm diversity, new economic, business and institutional arrangements both on-farm, in the value chain and food system, and in the innovation system, and emerging ways to ethically govern digital agriculture. Emerging lines of social science enquiry within these thematic clusters are identified and new lines are suggested to create a future research agenda on digital agriculture, smart farming and agriculture 4.0. Also, four potential new thematic social science clusters are also identified, which so far seem weakly developed: 1) Digital agriculture socio-cyber-physical-ecological systems conceptualizations; 2) Digital agriculture policy processes; 3) Digitally enabled agricultural transition pathways; and 4) Global geography of digital agriculture development. This future research agenda provides ample scope for future interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary science on precision farming, digital agriculture, smart farming and agriculture 4.0."
,,,"Based on the key metrics to monitor energy sector improvements from the International Energy Agency (IEA), transport emissions must decrease 43% by 2030. Freight logistics operations in Europe are struggling with ways to reduce their carbon footprints in order to adhere to regulations on governing logistics, while providing the increasing demand for sustainable products from the customers. This study investigates the anonymised microdata from the European Road Freight Transport Survey (2011â€“2014) to acquire patterns in logistic operations based on over 11 million journeys within 27 EU and EFTA countries involved. Different algorithms were implemented (Horizontal Cooperation, Pooling and Physical Internet) to analyse efficiency, in terms of vehicle utilisation, degree of vehiclesâ€™ loading during each journey and sustainability in terms of the amount of CO2 emissions per journey. This study shows that existing data can provide invaluable information on the efficiency of logistics operations and the positive effects data analytics can provide. Physical InternetÂ algorithm has performed better in terms of reducing emissions and improving the logisticsâ€™ efficiency, especially when the sample sizes are large, but this would require a shift to an open global supply web."
,,,"As one of the most promising technologies in the new round of fintech revolution, block chain technology has a broad application prospect. It is of great significance to apply the block chain technology in the field of financial support to agriculture and effectively improve the effect of financial support to agriculture for rural revitalization strategy. The purpose of this paper is to build a block chain supported agricultural financing solution for orders based on the analysis of the development status and existing problems of agricultural financing for orders. Through the construction and business development of the agricultural financing business scenario of placing orders in the block chain system, it is believed that the block chain technology has a great breakthrough in improving the credit system, improving the information asymmetry, building a smooth information transmission channel, improving the transaction reliability, improving the efficiency and reducing the cost of the traditional agricultural financing of orders. Finally, based on the research results, relevant policy Suggestions are put forward for the development of agricultural financing under the block chain technology. In view of the two agricultural enterprises studied in this paper, the annual net profit growth rate is above 2.3%, and the feasibility of innovative financing mode is judged, and corresponding policy Suggestions are put forward to optimize the financing mode of agricultural value chain for the risks existing in the current financing of agricultural value chain."
,,,"Research in cryptofinance has continued to consider whether Bitcoin possesses a safe haven property as traditionally defined by its correlation with other assets during times of market stress. However, this neglects other attributes of assets that are important to investors during periods of crisis. Bitcoin is more volatile, less liquid, and costlier to transact (in terms of time and fees) than other assets (including gold - the traditional safe haven) even in normal market conditions. Until the market matures, it is therefore unlikely to be worthwhile considering Bitcoin as a safe haven."
,,,"Technological development is a longstanding matter of concern in the comprehension of economic growth and wealth. However, a deeper understanding regarding the process of technological catching-up and development of emerging economies is yet to be further gathered. Thus, the aim of this article is to comprehend the path for developing frontier indigenous technologies through technology and knowledge transfer (TKT) and public-private partnerships (PPP). Based on a case-study of technological development in the field of molecular diagnostics in southern Brazil, this article provides a three-stage conical-helix model of technological catching up and development through TKT and PPPs. In the start-up stage, public research actors generate technological capabilities via TKT processes at the local level; in the catching-up stage, frontier technologies are gathered through a new TKT from international actors; in the rising-up stage, frontier technology is developed indigenously and transferred to national and international private industries through PPPs. Therefore, the conical-helix model presented in this study may potentially contribute to the development and implementation of a new generation of public policies for technological development in emerging economies, reducing technological dependence on imported technologies from developed nations."
,,,"The landscape of financial inclusion has for long been considered as the soft side of financial services, having received scarce attention from a financial, regulatory, and policy point of view, despite its central role within the global economic empowerment. Part of the disadvantaged and low-income segments of global population is left without (i.e. financially excluded) or very limited access (i.e. financially underserved) to basic financial services, creating a highly critical equality deficit in different parts of the world. In this frame of reference, financial exclusion still remains a highly critical problem that hinders developing regions around the world from eradicating poverty leading to large-scale starvation and civil unrest. Moreover, financial exclusion is interwoven with social dependency making financially excluded/underserved populations strongly dependable on their social networks. The emergence of FinTech, the new breed between financial innovation and financial technology, which has been challenging the prevailing position of incumbent financial institutions, is providing a promising vehicle of tackling this phenomenon by closing the gap between unbanked, under-banked and developed societies, opening the door to the global digital economy, bringing a long-term societal transformational change for the financially excluded/underserved, while leading to inclusive economic growth helping move towards a more just and equitable society."
,,,"This paper considers the potential significance of â€˜clean energy communitiesâ€™ (CECs) in the transformation of the present socio-technical regimes underlying our centralized energy systems, towards a more distributed and decentralized future. It explains the centralized, distributed, and decentralized sub-structures, embedded in current energy systems and energy markets. We analyze long-term dynamics and possible pathways of this transition, and the co-evolution of energy systems and communities, using an exploratory structure, drawing on insights from transition theories, innovation studies, and social network concepts. This includes analysis of the various forms of CECs â€“ including virtual power plants, peer-to-peer trading, microgrids, and community-scale energy projects â€“ emerging in a number of developed and developing jurisdictions, including Australia. This analysis suggests that low-carbon transition pathways will be varied, driven by social, technological, and organizational contexts, and shaped by institutional change processes, and interaction with the existing regime and incumbent actors. Social and technological entrepreneurs, and utilities, operating within an environment increasingly defined by energy consumers, industry groups, and policy actors, will need to be adaptable and innovative in choosing strategic directions, associated investment decisions, establishing appropriate alliances, and acquiring resources, to meet their goals in this low-carbon energy transition."
,,,"Our paper contributes to the nascent field of technological entrepreneurial intent by proposing a model linking studentsâ€™ entrepreneurial intent to digitalization of the economy, and providing evidence based on a small transition economy: Kosovo. Our sample is composed of 310 students from two universities in Kosovo (University of Pristina and University of Applied Sciences in Ferizaj). These two universities account for around 60% of student enrolment in Kosovo. We use a modified version of the Entrepreneurial Intention Questionnaire (EIQ) scale developed by LiÃ±Ã¡n and Chen (2009) which considers the extent of digitalization of the economy. The findings reveal that personal attitude and behavioral content are the main determinants of entrepreneurial intention; our structural model shows that they explain 72.7% of the total variance."
,,,"Today's digital technologies, such as social media, business analytics, the Internet of Things, big data, advanced manufacturing, 3D printing, cloud and cyber-solutions and MOOCs, permeate every private and public organization. However, even if this phenomenon has been analyzed for entrepreneurship in general, to the best of our knowledge, the impact of digital technologies on academic entrepreneurship remains not only slightly addressed. With the aim of filling this gap, this paper proposes a novel contribution regarding the emerging concept of Digital Academic Entrepreneurship. Based on a qualitative literature review, an interpretative framework for Digital Academic Entrepreneurship is deductively proposed that is composed of the following components: the rationale for the adoption of digital technologies for academic entrepreneurship (why), the emerging forms of digital academic entrepreneurship (what), the stakeholders involved through the digital technologies to achieve the academic entrepreneurship goal (who), and the processes of academic entrepreneurship supported by digital technologies (how). The discussion section provides a conceptualization of Digital Academic Entrepreneurship. The paper closes with the identification of a research agenda for this promising and under-researched field."
,,,"If the preceding chapters have shown us anything, then it is that telehealth is a potential means of delivering health care, rather than a simple expression of technology. While the technologies are relatively simple, the various implementations are notâ€”and are varied according to local need and system infrastructure, especially the infrastructure of government. This chapter intends to extend the learnings from the previous work by showcasing the achievements (and challenges) in specific countries."
,,,"Traceability has become an important feature in supply chain management. It can be adopted to identify the sources of many quality problems. In this paper, we develop a game theoretical model to study the role of traceability in combating product label misconduct. Specifically, we consider an industrial organization that assigns product labels to its members to certify their products in an output market. However, a member of the organization may choose to sell its product label to an unregulated party that makes unqualified units. The organization can choose between a traceable product label system and an untraceable one. The former has the advantage of identifying the responsible member when the inspection detects an unqualified unit. We derive the optimal inspection polices of the two product label systems and demonstrate that the organization may incur a higher cost by adopting the traceable rather than untraceable label system. This non-intuitive result indicates that without a proper management mechanism in place, the adoption of a traceable product label system may backfire. We extend our base model and show that our main insights are robust in various settings."
,,,"This paper empirically investigates the effects of intelligent logistics policies (ILPs) on shareholder value of the 149 listed logistics companies from 2013 to 2018 in China. The research shows that ILPs will result in a positive stock market reaction, and this effect is increasing along with the increase of policy contents related to intelligent logistics or the decrease of company service breadth. The market reaction will be affected by the way that policies are issued and type of company. The logistics service providers are more positive when their financial performances are better, while the opposite result is observed for logistics equipment manufacturers."
,,,"Apple Pay and digital wallets have gained popularity since the fall of 2014. Perceiving Apple Pay & digital wallets as a financial revolution at this moment might be a mistake. The following study shows that it is just the evolution of a payment system in Mexico and the United States of America, a system that opened the door to a possible future financial revolution. Current financial regulation in Mexico and the United States of America is not accurately applied; therefore, proper guidelines or amendments in financial regulations should be issued by financial authorities in order to mend the loopholes in the law."
,,,"Community microgrids implemented in existing electricity grids can meet both development targets set out in the Paris agreement: 1. mitigate greenhouse gas emissions through increased implementation of renewable energy sources, and 2. to adapt to climate related disturbances and risk of catastrophes. Community microgrids are, however, complex to implement and institutional change is needed to reach their full potential. The purpose of this article is to review existing literature and analyze institutional developments influencing the growth of community microgrids. The literature describes a concentration of microgrid activities in specific regions: USA, EU, Asia and Australia. Varying reasons for implementing community microgrids were found in the different regions but similar institutional developments occurred, albeit with differing emphasis due to contextual specificities. Formal directions do however influence informal institutions even though their aims differ. Power utilities stand out as a critical actor and both formal and informal institutions put pressure on utilities to update their traditional business models. This article illustrates how informal and formal institutions play a significant role in the growth of community microgrids in existing electricity grids and provide interesting examples which can be utilized by policymakers. Microgrid development is still in a formative phase and further institutional change in the form of updated regulations is needed."
,,,"In the modern business environment, consumers are increasingly influenced by megatrends involving marketplace, technology, socioeconomics, geopolitics, and natural environment. Simultaneously, the data and insights that can inform consumer attitudes and behaviors often reside outside of firms' direct control. Consciously incorporating these interdependent factors into firms' decision-making is essential for adaptability and sustainable profitability. Building on the â€œoutside-inâ€ perspective, we propose that firm strategies should be informed through the lens of the marketing ecosystem that considers the interrelated and dynamic megatrends. By leveraging advances in data and technology, firms can sense-make the marketplace by extracting insights from massive amounts of diverse consumer data with modern-day analytics. By mapping out the megatrends with marketing analytics, firms can 1) more accurately predict consumers' changing preferences and formulate appropriate strategies to engage with them; and 2) become more market-adaptable and competitive in the present and the future. To deliver sustainably compelling value to customers, firms should adopt an ecosystem mindset and cooperate with various stakeholders. A broad-thinking, agile, and humble firm culture can enable the development of more robust outside-in capabilities. We elaborate on the megatrends in the interconnected world of the marketing ecosystem, and propose emerging research directions in each area."
,,,"This introduction briefly examines the emerging field of â€˜conflict-freeâ€™, â€˜fairâ€™, and â€˜transparently sourced and tradedâ€™ minerals and the dynamics of their supply chains. Linking the growing prevalence of Corporate Social Responsibility norms in the global mining industry with increasing awareness of reputational risks associated with mineral extraction and trading that are associated with environmental impacts and armed conflict, the paper provides an overview of the Kimberley Process for rough diamonds and the various supply chain initiatives that it has inspired over the past 15 years. It distinguishes between conflict-free supply chains; efforts to embrace Fair Trade in artisanal mineral supply chains; and a third group of independently-organized interventions that lay claim to â€˜ethicalâ€™ or â€˜fairâ€™ labels for often very specific instances. Finally, it provides a brief overview of the papers included in the Special Section."
,,,"With increasing global shortage of fresh water resources, many countries are prioritizing desalination as a means of utilizing abundantly available seawater resources. Integrated energy efficiency evaluation is a scientific method for the quantitative analysis of energy efficiency based on multiple indicators and is very useful for investment, construction, and scientific decision-making for desalination projects. In this paper, the energy efficiency evaluation of the micro energy network (MEN) of desalination for multi-source and multi-load is studied, and the basic idea of comprehensive energy efficiency evaluation is analyzed. The process includes the use of a MEN model to establish an integrated energy efficiency evaluation index system, taking into consideration energy, equipment, economic, environmental, and social factors. A combined evaluation method considering subjective and objective comprehensive weights for multi-source multi-load desalination MENs is proposed to evaluate the energy efficiency of desalination and from multiple perspectives."
,,,"In this paper we show in a thought experiment that in an economy where i) investors hold rational expectations, ii) output is generated by a linear homogeneous production function, and iii) real investment is allocated across sectors according to the CAPM, a fractional reserve banking system is not Pareto efficient and amplifies the business cycle. In developing these results we show that these three well known propositions in economics also imply a new view of the business cycle, one where the business cycle is described in terms of the dispersion of an ex-ante probability distribution. The policy implication of this analysis is that bank regulation should go further than the Volcker rule or the Vickers commission proposal by restricting bank investments to currency and deposit accounts on the central bank. Nonbank financial institutions should then carry out the financial intermediation function now carried out by banks. The paper proposes that post office banking perhaps augmented with blockchain technology sometime in the future is one way to implement the transition from fractional reserve banking to full reserve banking. While little academic work has been done on full reserve banking in the aftermath of the Great Crisis, it is interesting to note that it is part of banking reform proposals now (July 2016) before the parliament in Iceland and a special national referendum in Switzerland."
,,,"Packaging enables the movement of product from its point of origin to its point of consumption and influences all other industries directly or indirectly. Despite technological advancements, increasing length of global supply chains for products has led to a simultaneous increase in the use of packaging layers and associated waste along the supply chain. Thus, packaging poses challenges and opportunities to the environment and society, with implications for supply chain costs. With growing popularity of concepts such as circular economy and sustainability, packaging and its relationship with sustainability and supply chain management in a circular economy needs to be studied. This paper presents a systematic literature review of studies done over the last 18 years with the objective to generate a greater understanding of the work done in the field of sustainable packaging in supply chain management (SPSCM). Our findings indicate SPSCM trends are aligned to circular economy concepts but have not adequately considered the interaction of the product with its packaging system. Research efforts in SPSCM are restricted to environmental and economic dimensions and are mostly concentrated in developed economies. The review identifies three main supply chain structures studied in SPSCM literature of which there has been an increased focus on fragmented portions and dyads of the supply chain with respect to packaging. The research contributes by identifying and mapping the collated literature to organizational theories that support and drive SPSCM. In particular, the institutional theory, stakeholder theory and ecological modernization theory are investigated from a SPSCM perspective. Further, the three organizational theories are used to develop a framework for circular economy to highlight future avenues for research and practice in SPSCM for a circular economy."
,,,"We calculated the matching values of technology supply and demand texts based on texts semantic similarity with Word2Vec and Cosine similarity algorithms, and then proposed a new index named Supply-Demand Matching Efficiency (SDME) to measure the matching efficiency of online technology trading platforms (OTTPs). Through the empirical research on the three types of OTTPs, the findings are as follows: First, the SDME of Zhejiang Market (Government-Owned, Government-Operated, GOGO), Technology E Market (Government-Owned, Contractor-Operated, GOCO), and Keyi Market (Market-Owned, Market-Operated, MOMO) are 64.69%, 54.38% and 28.99% respectively, indicating that the government plays an important role in attracting effective technology suppliers and demanders to participate in online trade and standardizing information expression, thereby improving the SDME. Second, by comparing the SDME and the newly announced signing rate of each OTTP, we found that the OTTP with high SDME also has high signing rate, and the changing trend of the two is consistent. Third, we used the TextRank and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to study the topic distribution of technology supply and demand, and calculated the topic differences of each OTTP, which are 70%, 75%, 84% respectively. The Technology E Market and Zhejiang Market have low topic differences and high SDME, while Keyi Market has high topic differences and low SDME, which indicated that the topic differences have a negative effect on SDME. Intuitively, measuring the semantic matching efficiency of supply and demand texts on OTTPs can help the suppliers and demanders to retrieve information accurately, and assist the OTTPs to carry out trade promotion and evaluate trade performance."
,,,"This paper deals with the analysis of the relationship between cryptocurrencies and gold prices. In particular, we use fractional integration and cointegration techniques to examine the degree of persistence of the series and the possibility of short and long run equilibrium relationships between them. Our results indicate that there is evidence of mean reversion in gold prices and also in some of the cryptocurrencies; however, cointegration is only found in a few cases with a very small degree of cointegration in the long run relationship. Testing the hypothesis of convergence throughout the ratios, again we only found evidence of mean reversion in the cases of Bytecoin, Dash, Ether, Monero and Ether."
,,,"Since the inception of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Next 11 (N11) countries are facing difficulties in attaining the SDG objectives, as maintaining the environmental quality has been a challenge for them. In this study, we have revisited the technology policies of these countries, and in doing so, we have tried to address the problem of environmental degradation, while addressing the issues of sustained economic growth, clean and affordable energy, and quality education. In this pursuit, we have designed two indices for environmental degradation and technological advancement, and then analyzed the association between them following the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. The empirical analysis has been done by IPAT framework, and by using bootstrapped quantile regression and rolling window heterogeneous panel casualty tests, over a period of 1990â€“2017. Following the results obtained from the analysis, we have tried to address the objectives of SDG 13, SDG 4, SDG 8, SDG 9, SDG 7, and SDG 10."
,,,"The ability to perform screening of potential vision-impairing diseases remotely with an Ophthalmologist-in-the-loop is crucial in serving the Medically Underserved Areas/Population (MUA/P) and in acute medical settings, such as emergency departments. With an estimated 217 million individuals affected by moderate to severe vision-impairing diseases worldwide and an increasing number of new patients with such diseases, the need for access to faster (or real-time) diagnosis on a large scale is imperative. It is evident that early diagnosis of chronic diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) could better prevent vision loss. In this paper, a scalable cloud based teleophthalmology architecture via the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) for diagnosis of AMD is presented. In the proposed architecture, patients wear a head-mounted camera (OphthoAI IoMT headset) to send their retinal fundus images to their secure and private cloud drive storage for personalized disease severity detection and predictive progression analysis. A proposed AMD-ResNet convolution neural network with 152 layers will then analyze the images to identify and determine AMD disease severity. The algorithm is trained with AREDS (age related eye disease study) images from the National Institute of Health (NIH) with over 130,000 fundus images captured over 12 years, and for determining AMD severity, we achieve a sensitivity and specificity of 94.97Â Â±Â 0.5% and 98.32Â Â±Â 0.1% respectively. A temporal Longâ€“Short Term Memory (LSTM) deep neural network for precision medicine and AMD predictive progression is also proposed. Patient personalization allows better targeted care, lesser side effects, and a greater likelihood of responding to treatments by tailoring healthcare on a per-patient basis."
,,,"The fourth industrial revolution and the underlying digital transformation, known as Industry 4.0, is progressing exponentially. The digital revolution is reshaping the way individuals live and work fundamentally, and the public remains optimistic regarding the opportunities Industry 4.0 may offer for sustainability. The present study contributes to the sustainability literature by systematically identifying the sustainability functions of Industry 4.0. In doing so, the study first reviews the fundamental design principles and technology trends of Industry 4.0 and introduces the architectural design of Industry 4.0. The study further draws on the interpretive structural modelling technique to model the contextual relationships among the Industry 4.0 sustainability functions. Results indicate that sophisticated precedence relationships exist among various sustainability functions of Industry 4.0. â€˜Matrice dâ€™Impacts CroisÃ©s Multiplication AppliquÃ©e Ã un Classementâ€™ (MICMAC) analysis reveals that economic sustainability functions such as production efficiency and business model innovation tend to be the more immediate outcome of Industry 4.0, which pays the way for development of more remote socioenvironmental sustainability functions of Industry 4.0 such as energy sustainability, harmful emission reduction, and social welfare improvement. This study can serve Industry 4.0 stakeholders â€“ leaders in the public and private sectors, industrialists, and academicians â€“ to better understand the opportunities that the digital revolution may offer for sustainability, and work together more closely to ensure that Industry 4.0 delivers the intended sustainability functions around the world as effectively, equally, and fairly as possible."

,,,"The contributors to this volume envisage how the transformation of the electric power industry is likely to evolve and what might be the impact of distributed energy resources on the incumbents and new entrants. This chapter acknowledges that while a myriad of new products and services are likely to emerge appealing to a growing number of prosumers, the bulk of customers are likely to remain solely or mostly dependent on the existing grid and reasonably content with bundled services at regulated tariffs. The resulting bifurcation of consumers and prosumers will be among the most vexing challenges facing regulators who must ultimately find ways to keep both constituents content without stifling innovation."
,,,"Green product innovation represented by information and communication technology (ICT) refers to an environmental production mode with innovation as the main carrier. As a key means to achieve the coordinated development of environmental protection and economic development, green product innovation is still in the lead-in period in China; since it is difficult to achieve rapid development only by relying on market forces, it needs government intervention and regulation. To guide the development of the green product innovation industry, this study analyzes the effect of environmental regulation and R&D tax incentives on green product innovation from a disciplinary and incentive perspective. Data from 30 regions in China from 2009 to 2017 are used. First, a panel model is proposed for the analysis of the entire country to determine the relationships among environmental regulation, R&D tax preferential policies, and green product innovation. Due to the regional differences in industrial structure and economic development level in the various regions of China, to enhance the accuracy of the research results, the inflection points of environmental regulations in different provinces are analyzed. The research results show a U-shaped relationship between environmental regulation and green product innovation, that is, given the increasing intensity of environmental regulation, its effect will gradually change from inhibition to promotion. Currently, most provinces in China are close to the inflection point of environmental regulation, meaning the regulation level needs to be further improved. Further, R&D tax incentives play a significant role in promoting green product innovation. The results not only identify the determinants of green product innovation but also provide a theoretical and decision-making framework for the industrial development and promotion of green product innovation in China."
,,,"Epidemiological surveillance of Tuberculosis (TB) requires a strong integration of different health services, programs and levels of care. The deepening and broadening of data management techniques must be constantly carried out to increase the integrality of healthcare. Otherwise, knowledge extraction and clinical and administrative decision-making processes are significantly hampered, directly affecting the management and quality of health services. Thus, this work aims to establish a computerized decision support system capable of collecting, integrating and sharing TB health data in Brazilian Unified Public Health System. Also, it will allow the monitoring of infected patients and the visualization of consolidated information of regular TB and its resistant variants for health professionals and managers. The data will be made available from heterogeneous, disconnected and unstructured sources by combining traditional web services, Semantic Web resources and security algorithms. A solid knowledge base applied to epidemiological surveillance, health information governance and clinical support will be enabled to integrate the multiple areas of TB patients care, as well as to support the creation of more accurate operational and diagnostics models."
,,,"The relationship between technology and healthcare society rises due to the intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) with endless networking capabilities for medical data analysis. Deep Neural Networks and the swift public embracement of medical wearable have been productively metamorphosed in the recent few years. Deep Neural Network-powered IoT allowed innovative developments for medical society and distinctive probabilities to the medical data analysis in the healthcare industry (Yin, Yang, Zhang, & Oki, 2016). Despite this progress, several issues still required to be handled while concerning the quality of service. The key to flourishing in the shift from client-oriented to patient-oriented medical data analysis for healthcare society is applying deep networks to provide a high level of quality in key attributes such as end-to-end response time, overhead and accuracy. In this paper, we propose a holistic Deep Neural Network-driven IoT smart health care method called, Grey Filter Bayesian Convolution Neural Network (GFB-CNN) based on real-time analytics. In this paper, we propose a holistic AI-driven IoT eHealth architecture based on the Grey Filter Bayesian Convolution Neural Network in which the key quality of service parameters like, time and overhead is reduced with a higher rate of accuracy. The feasibility of the method is investigated using a comprehensive Mobile HEALTH (MHEALTH) dataset. This illustrative example discusses and addresses all important aspects of the proposed method from design suggestions such as corresponding overheads, time, accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. By simulation, the performance of GFB-CNN method is compared to the state-of-the-art methods with various synthetically generated scenarios. Results show that with minimal time and overhead incurred for sensing and data collection, our method accurately evaluates medical data analysis for heart signals by efficient differentiation between healthy and unhealthy heart signals."
,,,"Fully decarbonizing global industry is essential to achieving climate stabilization, and reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050â€“2070 is necessary to limit global warming to 2Â Â°C. This paper assembles and evaluates technical and policy interventions, both on the supply side and on the demand side. It identifies measures that, employed together, can achieve net zero industrial emissions in the required timeframe. Key supply-side technologies include energy efficiency (especially at the system level), carbon capture, electrification, and zero-carbon hydrogen as a heat source and chemical feedstock. There are also promising technologies specific to each of the three top-emitting industries: cement, iron & steel, and chemicals & plastics. These include cement admixtures and alternative chemistries, several technological routes for zero-carbon steelmaking, and novel chemical catalysts and separation technologies. Crucial demand-side approaches include material-efficient design, reductions in material waste, substituting low-carbon for high-carbon materials, and circular economy interventions (such as improving product longevity, reusability, ease of refurbishment, and recyclability). Strategic, well-designed policy can accelerate innovation and provide incentives for technology deployment. High-value policies include carbon pricing with border adjustments or other price signals; robust government support for research, development, and deployment; and energy efficiency or emissions standards. These core policies should be supported by labeling and government procurement of low-carbon products, data collection and disclosure requirements, and recycling incentives. In implementing these policies, care must be taken to ensure a just transition for displaced workers and affected communities. Similarly, decarbonization must complement the human and economic development of low- and middle-income countries."

We propose an exchange theory of intellectual property based on a contracting approach in the context of market-making and enforcement of economic rights in exchange for monopoly taxation rights. We use a Hotelling (1929) type spatial model to show the relationship between location and pricing decisions of innovating firms under differing intellectual property, institutional quality, and taxation regimes."
,,,"In order to improve the corporate sustainability of agro-food value chains, business organizations need to rely on a higher performing and more reliable logistics system. Particularly, in case of dairy industry, organizations are facing some important challenges containing people management, short shelf life, high food losses and wastage, high greenhouse gas emissions. Based on â€œConfederation of Indian industry - Dairy Vision 2025â€, it is believed that the dairy sector in India has high potential if organizations can develop an effective logistics and supply chain system. This article attempts to analyze the interaction between distribution related challenges with a focus operational excellence and higher corporate green growth and sustainability viewpoints in food supply chains by considering the business example of four Indian dairy product based organizations using graph theory and matrix approach. Several key challenges were identified based on a literature survey and expertsâ€™ views. Graph theory and matrix approach has been applied to select the most significant challenge. The results show that food organizations must work on cold chain to manage logistics and distribution challenges to reduce wastage, decrease financial losses and to take environmental issues into account. This paper ranks the challenges as well as develop an index for the dairy industry to achieve corporate sustainability in its supply chain and logistics network. The present study findings will provide useful knowledge for managers and policy makers managing interaction between people and process aspects and corporate sustainability management in the agro-based diary organizational logistics and supply chains. This is one of the unique studies in food supply chain that helps in improving the logistics and supply performance in diary industries of emerging economies."
,,,"The continuous use of eGovernment services is a de facto for its prosperity and success. A generalised sense of citizens' self-efficacy, expectations, and satisfaction offer opportunities for governments to further retain needed engagements. This study examines the factors influencing citizens' continuance use of eGovernment services. Through the integration of Social Cognitive Theory, Expectation Confirmation Theory, DeLone and McLean IS success model, and E-S-QUAL, a survey of 471 citizens in the UK, engaging in online public services, found that prior experience, social influence, information quality, and service quality, personal outcome expectation, and satisfaction, are significant predictors of citizens' intention to use eGovernment, when they are regulated, through citizens' self-efficacy. The present study extends the roles of pre-adoption and post-adoption by offering a self-regulating process. Therefore, it demonstrates how critical it is for the government's leaders to understand the patterns of the long-term process for electronic systems continually."
,,,"Biogas energies still struggle to reach higher diffusion in Brazil. Addressing this issue, this chapter aims at discussing the problems hampering the development of biogas in Brazil. More specifically, this discussion focuses on the role of policies and regulations for these problems. For this, the evolution of biogas field in Brazil is understood as a technological innovation system, and its struggles as systemic problems. This chapter also borrows from policy mix literature to comprehend how policies influenced biogas activities. The findings indicate the Brazilian biogas field had four main phases in which biogas players influenced the institutional context only in the last one. However, this influence was undermined because of three main groups of systemic problems: little knowledge on biogas technologies, misalignment of financial conditions, and limited spectrum of interactions. These findings suggest the need for horizontal and vertical coordination to avoid inconsistencies with established policy mixes."

,,,"The convergence of technology and the city is commonly referred to as the â€˜smart cityâ€™. It is seen as a possible remedy for the challenges that urbanisation creates in the age of global climate change, and as an enabler of a sustainable and liveable urban future. A review of the abundant but fragmented literature on smart city theories and practices, nevertheless, reveals that there is a limited effort to capture a comprehensive understanding on how the complex and multidimensional nature of the drivers of smart cities are linked to desired outcomes. The paper aims to develop a clearer understanding on this new city model by identifying and linking the key drivers to desired outcomes, and then intertwining them in a multidimensional framework. The methodological approach of this research includes a systematic review of the literature on smart cities, focusing on those aimed at conceptual development and provide empirical evidence base. The review identifies that the literature reveals three types of drivers of smart citiesâ€”community, technology, policyâ€”which are linked to five desired outcomesâ€”productivity, sustainability, accessibility, wellbeing, liveability, governance. These drivers and outcomes altogether assemble a smart city framework, where each of them represents a distinctive dimension of the smart cities notion. This paper helps in expanding our understanding beyond a monocentric technology focus of the current common smart city practice."

It can reduce the risk of green finance and increase the rate of return of green energy projects, respectively. In addition, technical developments in the sphere of distributed ledger technologies provide the opportunity to increase the transparency in green finance and investments. This paper contributes to literature by proposing two applied frameworks, backed by theoretical models on green finance and investment based on projects size. The objective is to induce the private participation in green finance and investment."
,,,"Humanitarian and other development organisations are calling for replicable self-sustaining solutions to shared micro-utilities to ensure equitable modern energy delivery to energy-deprived village communities. Distributed smart microgrid technology allows for the efficient integration of sustainable resources to provide localised energy delivery at improved levels of reliability and resilience. Smart energy management in decentralised renewable systems requires computational intelligence to implement pivotal energy-aware/cost-aware procedures in decision-making for a conceptualised next generation Smart Village microgrid platform. Smart Village microgrid control automation aims at offering pragmatic and, intelligent control capabilities to perform price-based demand response energy management. This paper proposes the use of cascaded control abstraction in the implementation of a price-sensitive cyber-physical Smart Grid approach in a rural off-grid microgrid environment. The modular microgrid design integrates renewable energy resources through an adaptive control algorithm developed in a model-based design approach. The solution is based on distributed market-based control, using multi-agent transactive principles to navigate automated demand response. Multi-priority load clusters with the selective parallel control of non-intelligent device groups allow for prioritised supply/demand resource coordination. The proposed Smart Village solution operates as a self-regulating smart microgrid energy management system and by virtue of its market-based transactive reasoning approach is able to meet multiple operating requirements of rural village energy systems. Simulation results for this value-based control technique highlight the value of customer engagement combined with supply-, demand- and economic cost optimisation for hybrid renewable distributed energy microgrids."
,,,"This paper studies a supply chain in which the incumbent original equipment manufacturer is the quality leader and the encroaching contract manufacturer is the quality follower acting as a free rider for the formerâ€™s investment in quality improvement. Investigations were made into the contract manufacturerâ€™s encroaching conditions and the original equipment manufacturerâ€™s strategies of investment in quality improvement to deter the contract manufacturerâ€™s encroachment. Results show that, different from the traditional encroachment, the contract manufacturer always has the incentive to encroach on the original equipment manufacturerâ€™s final market if there is no quality investment opportunity. However, if quality investment is attainable for the original equipment manufacturer, there exists a threshold for the contract manufacturerâ€™s imitating capability, in excess of which the contract manufacturer will encroach on the original equipment manufacturerâ€™s final market. The structure of quality improvement plays a critical role regarding deterring the contract manufacturerâ€™s imitation and encroachment, and the encroachment is conditional when the contract manufacturerâ€™s imitating ability is relatively weak. Moreover, the threat of the potential entrant will facilitate the original equipment manufacturerâ€™s quality investment, even though the quality investment per se is unprofitable. Under certain conditions with quality investment, the contract manufacturerâ€™s encroachment can improve the original equipment manufacturerâ€™s profit, thus achieving a winâ€“win outcome."
,,,"Technology foresight is crucial in shaping the futures of social good that brings intrinsic and instrumental values to engage different stakeholders in the process. Within this context, the impact of technological innovation on the society from a multi-dimensional perspective is understudied. This paper addresses and investigates this gap by applying a qualitative survey of 137 experts. The survey's results are then treated using quantitative cross-sectional analysis to examine the interrelationships between lifestyle domains. Our findings indicate that technological innovation benefits society by improving communication and productivity in the supply chain. However, it causes unintended consequences such as deepening inequality and increasing the surveillance of the public. In addition, although technology provides more options for environmentally conscious choices and better infrastructure, its affordability is a concern. The paper concludes that social dimensions merit greater consideration in terms of multi-dimensional analysis and policy implications. It proposes future research to consider wellbeing as a key determining factor in deciding whether certain technology should be promoted to add value to the social good."
,,,"We empirically identify carry trade activities under the disguise of bitcoin transactions on USD and CNY bitcoin exchanges during the post global financial crisis period. Relying on variations of bitcoin exchange pairs and two policy shocks, we find the evidence of inflow capital control evasion. We show that the relative CNY to USD bitcoin price, indicating capital inflow volume, of those with high excessive currency conversion profit respond significantly more negatively to carry trade returns. Moreover, this relationship becomes significantly weaker when China tightens its regulations on bitcoin transactions."
,,,"In recent decades, the implementation of electronic health record (EHR) systems has been evolving worldwide, leading to the creation of immense data volume in healthcare. Moreover, there has been a call for research studies to enhance personalized medicine and develop clinical decision support systems (CDSS) by analyzing the available EHR data. In EHR data, usually, there are millions of patients records with hundreds of features collected over a long period of time. This enormity of EHR data poses significant challenges, one of which is dealing with many variables with very high degrees of missing values. In this study, the data quality issue of incompleteness in EHR data is discussed, and a framework called â€˜Missing Careâ€™ is introduced to address this issue. Using Missing Care, researchers will be able to select the most important variables at an acceptable missing values degree to develop predictive models with high predictive power. Moreover, Missing Care is applied to analyze a unique, large EHR data to develop a CDSS for detecting Parkinson's disease. Parkinson is a complex disease, and even a specialist's diagnosis is not without error. Besides, there is a lack of access to specialists in more remote areas, and as a result, about half of the patients with Parkinson's disease in the US remain undiagnosed. The developed CDSS can be integrated into EHR systems or utilized as an independent tool by healthcare practitioners who are not necessarily specialists; therefore, making up for the limited access to specialized care in remote areas."
,,,"In light of the concerted efforts to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) per the so-called Paris Agreement, the Information and Communication Industry (ICT) has received little attention as a significant contributor to GHGE and if anything is often highly praised for enabling efficiencies that help reduce other industry sectors footprint. In this paper, we aim at assessing the global carbon footprint of the overall ICT industry, including the contribution from the main consumer devices, the data centers and communication networks, and compare it with the to the total worldwide GHGE. We conduct a detailed and rigorous analysis of the ICT global carbon footprint, including both the production and the operational energy of ICT devices, as well as the operational energy for the supporting ICT infrastructure. We then compare this contribution to the global 2016-level GHGE. We have found that, if unchecked, ICT GHGE relative contribution could grow from roughly 1â€“1.6% in 2007 to exceed 14% of the 2016-level worldwide GHGE by 2040, accounting for more than half of the current relative contribution of the whole transportation sector. Our study also highlights the contribution of smart phones and shows that by 2020, the footprint of smart phones alone would surpass the individual contribution of desktops, laptops and displays. Finally, we offer some actionable recommendations on how to mitigate and curb the ICT explosive GHGE footprint, through a combination of renewable energy use, tax policies, managerial actions and alternative business models."
,,,"This paper presents an analysis of Industry 4.0 implementation in Kazakhstan and shows that it is more advantageous to adopt a global perspective and to target to the global community rather than narrow focus of economic growth and consideration of only short-term inner interests. The current state and importance of Fourth Industrialization for the country as well as opportunities and challenges of its realization in Kazakhstan have been discussed in more detail. It has been shown that a number of large enterprises of the country implements Industry 4.0 by applying global standards, which in turn increased their productivity and competitiveness not only in Kazakhstan but also in the world."
,,,"In this article, a new business model considering multiple stakeholders is proposed to develop a framework for third-party investment and future flexible retail electricity market in community microgrids. The proposed two-stage optimisation platform generates opportunities for multiple stakeholders to invest in the design of community microgrids, comprising multiple and different distributed energy resources such as renewable generation units, battery energy storage systems, and micro diesel engines, to minimize daily operational costs of the system. To proliferate the prosumers in retail energy markets as per the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets, United Kingdom, a peer-to-peer energy trading and energy management scheme is also proposed. The optimal sizing of urban and remote community microgrids are determined in stage-1, followed by their optimal operations to minimise the daily operating cost of the community system in stage-2. An improved version of the genetic algorithm is employed to optimise decision variables in both the stages. Different cases are investigated which show the tremendous potential of revenue generation for all stakeholders while effectively optimizing techno-economic operations of microgrids."
,,,"This article describes an epochal review of research literature on practice-oriented digital health ecosystems that have emerged during the period between 1998 and 2018. Practice-orientation refers to efforts that have resulted in positive impact and transformations in the delivery of healthcare. The review is epochal in the sense that there have been 3 major stages of innovation and diffusion in digital health that are identified. The year 1998 was deemed a significant starting point for the literature search because it marked the introduction of the term e-health. The main objective of this review is to track the evolution of digital health and the conspicuous developments in the field - crucial steps to get a grasp of the key issues involving the delivery of healthcare. The article includes a general discussion of these various key issues and sensitizing concepts. The sense-making thus shed some light on the areas of enquiry, which are central to identifying the direction in which the practice of healthcare is headed. These areas of enquiry often referred to as â€˜substantive areasâ€™ in qualitative research terminology, were identified as â€˜electronic medical recordsâ€™, â€˜health cloudâ€™, â€˜data analyticsâ€™, â€˜Internet-enabled devicesâ€™, and other â€˜emerging information technologiesâ€™. The article concludes with a synthesis of key inferences drawn from the epochal review. The digital disruption of healthcare has created necessary conditions for its offering as a global, interoperable service."

,,,Synopsis
,,,"Per capita consumption of plastic continues to increase and remains at high levels in high-income countries, despite obvious contributions to the global problem of plastics pollution. This paper attempts to provide an explanation for this phenomenon based on construal level theory, positing that plastic waste is a problem that is perceived as â€œout of sight and out of mindâ€ for consumers in high plastic consumption (typically high income) countries and that this is influenced by the export of plastic waste to other (typically lower income and lower consumption) countries for disposal â€“ shifting the burden of mismanaged plastic waste and perceptions of plastics pollution in the countries creating the majority of plastic waste. The apparent lack of plastics pollution in a local environment becomes a mediator, influenced by the export of plastic waste, which may then contribute to further plastics consumption. The theory is tested using structural equation modelling using rare, available matched data for mismanaged plastic waste, plastic waste exports, and plastics consumption at an aggregate country level. All study hypotheses are supported. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research and practice, including potential changes to government policy aimed at reducing future plastics consumption and pollution."
,,,"Food supply chains face challenges of sustainable supply chain management, such as waste management and environmental issues. Vertical integration or system integration is a corporate strategy for chicken production managed by the focal company. This research study discusses the role of the focal company for achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs) in a Brazilian food poultry supply chain. The research consisted of a single case study with the following steps: literature review, identification of the gaps, concepts synthesis, and case study. The findings indicated theoretical and empirical guidelines for SDGs. The literature review indicated the relevance of exploring some approaches to achieve sustainable supply chain management: corporate social responsibility, green supply chain management, industrial ecology, stakeholder theory, circular economy (reduce, reuse, and recycle with economic prosperity), and sustainability science. The focal company plays a strategic role in the vertical integration operation of the Brazilian poultry supply chain. The case study findings indicate the role of the focal company toward the actors, including the feed mill supplier, live poultry transport, poultry processor, rendering plant, and distributor. However, much remains to be accomplished to answer the question â€œhow to be sustainable?â€œ, especially in environmental and social issues involving all actors in the poultry supply chain. The Brazilian environmental legislation still needs to be revised to be aligned with SDGs because the legislation will not guarantee sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources. The critical issues and challenges are radical changes in business models, measurement of supply chain impacts, collaboration and network picturing, corporate social responsibility versus supply chain responsibility, stakeholder engagement, frameworks to implement SDGs, education about SDGs and public participation, and food supply chain integrated system forums."
,,,"Energy is the foundation and driving force of modernization. Renewable energy has been developed with the help of global environmental awareness. In recent years, supported by the relevant national industrial policies, China's photovoltaic market has developed rapidly and its production capacity is huge. However, the core of supporting the sustainable development of an industry lies in the continuous appreciation of the value of itself. In order to correctly understand the status quo and problems of PV industry value chain in China, based on the â€œSmile Curveâ€ theory, taking the gross profit rate of PV industry listed companies as sample variables from 2015 to 2017, the research finds that its value chain shows a gradually deepening smile. And to explore the extent to which gross profit margin is affected by various factors, 15 variables are selected from six aspects: internal innovation power, growth potential, profitability, operational efficiency, scale strength and external environment, the Stepwise Regression method is used to determine the optimal model first. Further use Principal Component Analysis to confirm the motivations affecting the value-added of listed companies in the PV industry in the upper, middle and down reaches. The results indicate that only 6 variables have significant effects on the gross profit margin of the PV industry value chain, and there are big diversities in the main influencing factors of the value-added capacity of PV companies in different links, so they should seek their own value-added breakthroughs."
,,,"It is paradox that in globalized world more than one third of its population is excluded from formal financial system. The body of evidence suggests that appropriate financial services can help improve household welfare and promote small enterprises. The financial exclusion is attributed to various reasons. Conventional financial system has several inherent limitations which lead to unserved population. Digital currency and mobile technology can spur penetration of financial system partially in unserved population. The evidence shows that high cost for small ticket size financial transaction in conventional financial system makes the transactions unviable. Digital currency and mobile technology can cater the needs of small transaction at affordable cost. It can also help reducing time, more accurately and make faster transactions in bulk. Many emerging economies like India, Brazil, and Nigeria have embarked on mobile technology to overcome financial exclusion. This chapter sheds light on opportunities, challenges, solutions, global experience in floating digital currency, and using mobile technology for financial inclusion."
,,,"The potential of smart cities in remediating environmental problems in general and waste management, in particular, is an important question that needs to be investigated in academic research. Built on an integrative review of the literature, this study offers insights into the potential of smart cities and connected communities in facilitating waste management efforts. Shortcomings of existing waste management practices are highlighted and a conceptual framework for a centralized waste management system is proposed, where three interconnected elements are discussed: (1) an infrastructure for proper collection of product lifecycle data to facilitate full visibility throughout the entire lifespan of a product, (2) a set of new business models relied on product lifecycle data to prevent waste generation, and (3) an intelligent sensor-based infrastructure for proper upstream waste separation and on-time collection. The proposed framework highlights the value of product lifecycle data in reducing waste and enhancing waste recovery and the need for connecting waste management practices to the whole product life-cycle. An example of the use of tracking and data sharing technologies for investigating the waste management issues has been discussed. Finally, the success factors for implementing the proposed framework and some thoughts on future research directions have been discussed."
,,,"There has been a tremendous growth in the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) in recent years. One important application area for the IoT is in the area of assistive technologies. Assistive technology can improve the functional capabilities of persons with disabilities by, for example, improved mobility and accessibility. IoT technologies, by virtue of their ubiquity and edge intelligence, can significantly enhance the provision of such services. IoT systems may deal with large amounts of data. In the assistive technologies context, this data can be particularly sensitive, as it may include health, location, and other highly personal information. Security then becomes a pressing concern in IoT-enabled assistive technology. In the IoT, security and privacy are major challenges due the characteristics of such systems (e.g., resource-constrained nature of the devices and high mobility). Given the large amount of personal data involved, and the potential reliance on IoT devices in the home and in usersâ€™ lives, access to data and resources is an important aspect of security in such systems. This chapter provides a discussion of the critical issue of security in IoT-enabled assistive technologies, particularly addressing access control. After identifying the requirements for such a mechanism and detailing a number of use cases, we present a fine-grained access control architecture for use in IoT-enabled assistive technology based on a combination of attributes, roles, and capabilities. We then discuss the issue of access right delegation for such systems. This will allow flexible and dynamic propagation of access rights in a manner suited to the characteristics of these systems. Finally, we outline a set of challenges that are significant when considering issues for security in IoT-enabled assistive technologies and demonstrate how our design satisfies the identified requirements."
,,,"Research conducted in the innovation field lags behind organizationsâ€™ general technological development and innovativeness. Literature that previously depicted innovation types in developed markets is markedly different from progressively publicized emerging market innovation types. While capital-abundant firms tend to engage in respective pioneering and incremental innovation loops, resource-constrained firms and firms in emerging countries may partially free-ride on existing products and services through innovations such as copycat and frugal. To date, there have been no attempts to holistically consolidate product and service innovation types into one overarching typology. Using novel methods of text mining and co-citation analysis, this study systematically maps three decades of product and service innovation scholarship to provide a typology of eight major product and service innovation types. This is further supported by case study analysis to demonstrate how these innovation types fit into the cost vs market novelty matrix. This study is unique in its methodological proposition to systematically review the innovation scholarship of more than 1,400 articles through comprehensive, quantified, and objective methods that offer transparent and reproducible results. The study provides some clarity regarding the classifications and characteristics of the innovation typology."
,,,"The prospects for a smart power system have been widely discussed in the global electricity sector. Decarbonization, Digitalization and Decentralization are considered the main key drivers for this power system transition and Brazil is no exception to this universal trend. A search of the literature revealed few studies which attempt to address the main challenges and opportunities towards a smart grid power system in Brazil. This paper provides an up-to-date assessment of the present and potential capabilities of existing and future technologies, regulations and policies and attempts to identify how these elements are interrelated. Our findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that policies for Distributed Generation (DG), Demand-Side Management (DSM) and new tariff schemes are on a path of accelerated deployment in the country. The deployment of storage technologies, however, is at a slow pace of growth. We highlight the need to further develop new business models to address the various decentralized energy technologies and services that are emerging in the sector. The current net-metering system is considered a key issue to be addressed as this regulatory structure may shift the costs from DG to non-DG users."
,,,"While many consider cryptocurrency regulation necessary because of their potential for illicit use, heavy-handed regulation would overburden the development of a nascent industry that has captured the imagination of many. This chapter reflects on a number of key issues that arise from cryptocurrency regulation in the Singapore context and proposes a â€œfacilitativeâ€ model for optimal regulation in Singapore. A premise of this model is that regulation need not be anti-industry, and facilitative regulation can help to reduce both investor and end-user uncertainty while promoting widespread acceptance and legitimacy."
,,,"In the context of economic crisis, it is necessary to drive changes in the productive model towards a smart society. Particularly in urban areas, the Smart City movement has become an agent for change to help fight the loss of competitiveness and unemployment. Literature review shows that there is little regarding the generation of knowledge and entrepreneurial activity in the context of a smart city and in Spain in particular. This study contributes to filling this gap. We start by identifying the potential sources of entrepreneurial opportunities that a medium-sized smart city may offer based on the Knowledge Spillover Theory of Entrepreneurship. We then provide empirical evidence that the Smart City label has positively influenced the effective creation of new businesses. To this end, we examine 44 Spanish Smart City initiatives included and classified in the Smart City Index according to their smartness level. Our results confirm the relation between the Smart City label and the entrepreneurship rate. Moreover, they allow us to present some relevant considerations and implications concerning the maturing process of Smart City initiatives. These considerations are of particular interest for those agents involved in the smart city entrepreneurial ecosystem."
,,,"The recast of the European Union Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) entered into force in December 2018, followed by the Internal Electricity Market Directive (IEMD) and Regulation (IEMR) as part of the Clean Energy for all Europeans Package. The RED II, that the 28 Member States have until June 2021 to transpose into national law, defines â€œRenewable Energy Communitiesâ€ (RECs), introduces a governance model for them and the possibility of energy sharing within the REC. It also provides an â€œenabling frameworkâ€ to put RECs on equal footing with other market players and to promote and facilitate their development. This article defines ""renewable energy clusters"" that are comprised of complementarity of different energy sources, flexibility, interconnectivity of different actors and bi-directionality of energy flows. We argue that RECs and RE clusters are socio-technical mirrors of the same concept, necessary in a renewable energy transition. To test how these new rules will fare in practice, drawing on a secondary dataset of 67 best-practice cases of consumer (co-)ownership from 18 countries, each project is assessed using the criteria of cluster potential, and for the extent that they meet the RED II governance requirements of heterogeneity of members and of ownership structure. Nine cases were identified as having cluster potential all of which were in rural areas. Of these, five projects were found to be both RECs and RE clusters. The absence of the governance and heterogeneity criteria is observed in projects that fall short of the cluster elements of flexibility, bi-directionality and interconnectivity, while cluster elements occur where the governance and heterogeneity criteria are met. When transposing the new rules into national law we recommend careful attention to encourage complementarity of renewables, RECs in urban contexts and â€œregulatory sandboxesâ€ for experimentation to find the range of optimal preferential conditions of the â€œenabling frameworkâ€."
,,,"The textile/apparel industry is of great importance to the economy in terms of trade, employment, investment and revenue all over the world. This sector is however characterised by substantial losses, due to production excesses on the one hand, and the â€œthrow awayâ€ culture on the other. This state of affairs suggests that textile recycling is needed. Apart from the environmental and ecological advantages which can be brought about by the re-use and recycling of textiles, there are many benefits of a socio-economic nature. This paper analyses current trends on textile recycling, the barriers impeding greater recycling, and outlines the socio-economic advantages of moving towards a circular economy. Some examples of on-going initiatives are discussed, together with some of the measures that may be used to further reduce the current waste deriving from the apparel sector."
,,,"The world population is estimated to reach nine billion by 2050. Many challenges are adding pressure on the current agriculture supply chains that include shrinking land sizes, ever increasing demand for natural resources and environmental issues. The agriculture systems need a major transformation from the traditional practices to precision agriculture or smart farming practices to overcome these challenges. Geographic information system (GIS) is one such technology that pushes the current methods to precision agriculture. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review (SLR) of 120 research papers on various applications of big GIS analytics (BGA) in agriculture. The selected papers are classified into two broad categories; the level of analytics and GIS applications in agriculture. The GIS applications viz., land suitability, site search and selection, resource allocation, impact assessment, land allocation, and knowledge-based systems are considered in this study. The outcome of this study is a proposed BGA framework for agriculture supply chain. This framework identifies big data analytics to play a significant role in improving the quality of GIS application in agriculture and provides the researchers, practitioners, and policymakers with guidelines on the successful management of big GIS data for improved agricultural productivity."
,,,"Additive manufacturing (colloquially: 3D printing) is a highly discussed topic. Previous research has argued that this technology not only has profound effects on manufacturing businesses but also on society, which demands new corporate strategies and policies alike. Thus, the development of reliable future scenarios is key for strategic planning and decision making as well as for future research. Dedicated academic studies in this field remain scarce. We present the results of an extensive Delphi survey on the future of additive manufacturing with a focus on its economic and societal implications in 2030. Via an initial round of extensive qualitative interviews and a Delphi-based analysis of 3510 quantitative estimations and 1172 qualitative comments from 65 experts, we were able to develop and validate 18 projections that were then clustered into a scenario for the most probable future. The scenario is built on the six Delphi projections with the highest consensus on the likelihood of occurrence. We complement this most probable scenario with a discussion on controversial, extreme scenarios. Based on these findings we derive implications for industry, policy, and future research."
,,,"Big Data, blockchains, and cloud computing have become ubiquitous in today's mass media and are universally known terms used in everyday speech. If we look behind these often misused buzzwords, we find at least one common element, namely data. Although we hardly use these terms in the â€œclassic disciplineâ€ of mineral economics, we find various similarities. The case of phosphate data bears numerous challenges in multiple forms such as uncertainties, fuzziness, or misunderstandings. Often simulation models are used to support decision-making processes. For all these models, reliable and accurate sets of data are an essential premise. A significant number of data series relating to the phosphorus supply chain, including resource inventory or production, consumption, and trade data ranging from phosphate rock to intermediates like marketable concentrate to final phosphate fertilizers, is available. Data analysts and modelers must often choose from various sources, and they also depend on data access. Based on a transdisciplinary orientation, we aim to help colleagues in all fields by illustrating quantitative differences among the reported data, taking a somewhat engineering approach. We use common descriptive statistics to measure and causally explain discrepancies in global phosphate-rock production data issued by the US Geological Survey, the British Geological Survey, Austrian World Mining Data, the International Fertilizer Association, and CRU International over time, with a focus on the most recent years. Furthermore, we provide two snapshots of global-trade flows for phosphate-rock concentrate, in 2015 and 1985, and compare these to an approach using total-nutrient data. We find discrepancies of up to 30% in reported global production volume, whereby the major share could be assigned directly to China and Peru. Consequently, we call for a global, independent agency to collect and monitor phosphate data in order to reduce uncertainties or fuzziness and, thereby, ultimately support policy-making processes."
,,,"It has long been known that time-averaged and geographically averaged retail tariffs distort end-customerâ€™s incentives to use and invest in appliances and energy efficiency. This problem is even more acute when end-customers can invest in and use on-site generation and storage. What tariff should be paid for the output of that generation or storage? Should the customer be able to use that output to offset his/her own consumption? Should the customer be able to sell any surplus to neighbors at the local retail rate? This chapter shows that with current retail tariffs, these policies have both pros and cons. Net metering and peer-to-peer trade will remain controversial as long as retail tariffs are not cost reflective."
,,,"In this chapter we provide a summary of the research workshops at IATBR2018. They are reflections on the conference theme and the context within which we are doing travel behavior research today. These workshops also represent some of the most exciting areas in our research. Workshop participants, coordinated by their chair(s), refined the scope of each workshop based on the assigned topic, identified research gaps, developed research themes, defined motivation for the research, and then created a list of specific research needs and questions. The wroskhops are on: Automation and Self-Driving, Mobility as a Service, Time Use and Travel, Data-Driven Learning and Travel, Transport for Healthy-Happy-Holistic Living, Life-Course and Dynamics, Big Data and Travel, and Connected Freight."
,,,"This discussion paper explores the relationship between biodiversity and the circular economy and the potential implications of this relationship. The circular economy has emerged as an alternative model to a traditional linear economy. It aims to tackle the resource exploitation that accompanies a linear economy and decouple economic growth from reliance on primary resources. In the face of global environmental degradation and an urgent need for change, the concept has become popular around the world and has led to the release of national policies and strategies on the circular economy. Problematically, while the basic concept is clear, it is ambiguous in how it will achieve some of its objectives, and it fails to address some key issues. In light of the accelerating rate of change, precipitous biodiversity decline is one such key issue. Through a content analysis of relevant circular economy publications, authors demonstrate that biodiversity protection is rarely mentioned in theory and policy. While the circular economy holds many benefits for society, its evasion of scrutiny has prevented it from manifesting in a comprehensive solution to environmental issues. The circular economy advocates for biomimicry, ecosystem service valuation, bioeconomy, and renewable energy. Each of these, however, has its own set of conflicts with biodiversity protection. Given the imminent need to protect biodiversity, the authors call for further research on the interaction between biodiversity and the circular economy, and for circular economy advocates to explicitly acknowledge the concept's limitations, thereby revealing the need for intersectional and complementary policies which aim to protect biodiversity."
,,,"Input-driven policy is typically designed to support R&D and contribute to the enhancement of innovation competences in individual firms. However, it is not clear whether this â€˜more is betterâ€™ approach has contributed to the establishment of a vibrant innovation ecosystem by stimulating firmsâ€™ inclination to collaborate. The current study investigates this question by analysing the data from 489 Korean innovative manufacturing firms using a propensity score matching analysis. As expected, the link to increased innovation collaborations was statistically significant between the recipients and R&D subsidies. The results show that R&D subsidies stimulate firms to choose partners more adventurously, by going outside the traditional value chains and regional boundaries. However, the impact of subsidies on innovation collaboration followed an inverted U-shaped curve: the impact in highly funded firms was smaller than that in firms that received a more modest amount. This finding suggests that government support encourages firms to work with a heterogeneous range of partners and to develop more diversified ecosystems. Our study suggests that different policy impacts, such as input and behavioural additionality, can occur simultaneously and even influence each other. Thus, there is a strong need for policy makers to develop more sophisticated policy tools for open innovation promotion."
,,,"This Viewpoint briefly considers the implications of, and possible policy responses to, the critical role of minerals and metals in the current â€œenergy transitionâ€. That transition is most often described in terms of the worldâ€™s energy systems moving towards cleaner and low-carbon technologies and systems. No matter how the contours of this transition eventually manifest, it will likely have significant impacts on the supply and trade of certain minerals and metals. There are several recent scenarios analyses considering these implications with a focus on materials required for solar photovoltaics and electric vehicles. In addition to technical aspects, there are critical geopolitical, economic, environmental, social, and governance issues arising. The paper concludes with recommendations for possible policy and regulatory responses in areas ranging from resource mapping to political economy."
,,,"Records of human civilization portray a history of the rise and fall of urban settlements, which have functioned as the nuclei of human activities in all ancient and modern civilizations. Cities are where the fabric of human destiny is woven and where scientific innovations and technological achievements are predominantly reflected. The main focus of todayâ€™s urban managers is to cope with the tremendous changes occurring as a result of the megatrend of urbanization. As such, this article provides a contextual discourse on the subject of contemporary urbanization. It looks at historical circumstances, the nature of city problems and challenges that have arisen, the initiatives that are being taken to counteract manifest difficulties including application of the concept of urban sustainability, and the value of robust measurement of the effectiveness of city sustainability initiatives."
,,,"In recent years, the new technological keywords, FinTech and IoT (Internet of Things) have attracted interest, and at the same time, as they have already become buzz words, a gap has appeared between technologies and services that will penetrate the market and those which will disappear. Recent years have seen a remarkable trend for companies in all business sectors and industries to try to improve and extend the lifetime of their existing businesses and services by introducing the newest technologies. There is a requirement for FinTech or IoT to be integrated into the society in order to move beyond this goal, and to create new business models or services that are not descended from their existing business fields or services itself. While some simply maintain existing business areas that lack potential for company development, several companies find it difficult to develop business through advanced concepts, because they are bound by their existing capabilities. Thus, there is a need to find ways to create the business models and services that surpass vested interests, are sustainable, and which fulfil the demands of the society. Products and services using technology have been in demand through the years, and occasionally, they can actually threaten the survival of existing businesses; this clearly demonstrates that such products and services are truly indispensable for social creation. This paper aims to discuss the conceptualization of approaches necessary to create such products and services, and to provide ideas for new services by introducing examples."
,,,"FinTech crowd funding mechanism has gained popularity as an alternative of entrepreneurial financing worldwide. This paper reviews the challenges and dynamics of FinTech crowd funding platforms in the continents of USA, Europe and Asia. The case study analysis of Thailand, an emerging Asian country, under the policy direction of â€œThailand 4.0â€ provides interesting results that can be applied to other developing economies with regard to start-up financing. The findings point out the barriers both at the policy and operation levels underlying the Thai entrepreneurial innovation system. The paper provides lessons and implications to strengthen the FinTech crowd funding platform."
,,,"An increasing number of innovators and disrupters are positioning themselves in the sweet spot where large numbers of behind-the-meter assets can be successfully aggregated, remotely monitored, managed and optimized, reducing energy bills for the participants while delivering valuable services to other stakeholders such as the network and/or the wholesale market. This chapter provides examples of the innovators in this emerging space, the challenges they face and how they may further disrupt the traditional relationships between the incumbents and the consumers."
,,,"This paper reviews the Academic Entrepreneurship literature according to the emergence of powerful Digital technologies, providing an overview of the state of research and outlining a future research agenda about Digital Academic Entrepreneurship. One hundred and sixty-five journal papers were initially extracted from Scopus and their content was analysed for the paper selection process by two researchers in parallel, plus a third one in case of uncertainty. Finally, fifty-nine papers dealing with digital academic entrepreneurship and published in a variety of academic journals have been analyzed through a content and a bibliometric analysis. Findings show that literature on Digital Academic Entrepreneurship is really scant and dominated by unrelated research. Content analysis provides the emergence of four major research streams: 1) Digital Technologies for Entrepreneurship Education; 2) The â€œmaker space movementâ€ for Academic Entrepreneurship; 3) Digital technologies for discovering entrepreneurial opportunities; 4) Creating entrepreneurial competences in the Digital â€œUniversity-basedâ€ Entrepreneurial ecosystems. The paper presents the first attempt to provide a comprehensive structured literature review of the disruptive role of digital transformation for the Academic Entrepreneurship. Despite the growing literature on Digital Entrepreneurship, this research area is still fragmented and undertheorized. More systematic and holistic studies, considering both the technological, economic and the social aspects of Academic Entrepreneurship are required."
,,,"For all the evolutionary ages of mineral resource development, there have not been concerns about sustainable mining until the 21st century. Thus, this paper explores the extent to which emerging geospatial technologies have been deliberately used in the mining industry activities to achieve the United Nations Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. Governments, the mining industry, Non-Governmental and International Organisations have various investments in geospatial programmes and technologies for Environmental and Social Impact Assessments and baseline studies to enhance the achievement of these goals. However, these efforts prove inadequate to link the social, environmental and economic baseline analysis of sustainable development goals. The observations in this paper, therefore, have been obtained largely from extensive literature review to gain a broad understanding of previous and current applications of emerging technologies in the field. The literature has been explored in two successive steps. First, the literature was broadly queried to find the most current works on sustainable mining for three decades (i.e. 1990 to 2019). Second, out of over 100 papers, reports, and books retrieved in the first step, a more specific search and analysis of existing academic and industry literature on the explicit applications of emerging geospatial technology for enhancing sustainable development in the mining sector was conducted. In spite of its ensemble of capabilities for multivariate analysis, analysis of the literature reveals that there is inadequate adaptation of emerging geospatial technologies, which can simultaneously measure and link generally acceptable social, economic and environmental costs and benefits of mining for sustainability considerations in a local setting. There is a dearth of literature that discuss this new approach in addressing sustainable mining. Findings of this paper shall, therefore, inform the scientific community, industry, Non-Governmental Organisations and consultants on emerging approaches to address salient issues of sustainable mining towards meeting the agenda 2030 SDGs."
,,,"The energy supply sector is the largest contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. A good understanding of energy systems from existing research will provide multidimensional insights for appropriate actions against global warming. This study conducts a systematic review of the literature covering 1,184 articles on energy issues dealing with climate change mitigation. Using a novel hand-coding typology analysis, we characterize the body of knowledge and identify possible research gaps according to the heterogeneity of the energy process, time scale, geographic location, energy technology, and concerned end-use sector. We find that research interest mainly focuses on the energy supply (496 papers) and the end-use process (359 papers). Energy storage and the energyâ€“waterâ€“land nexus are two emerging areas. Biomass, solar, wind, and nuclear energy are the technologies that attract the most attention, while interest in hydrogen energy production and waste-to-energy has grown very recently. The cost-benefit and mitigation potential of renewable generation are the most studied topics, followed by the impacts of climate change on electricity production. In contrast, little attention is paid to research on traditional oil and gas exploration. Regarding the end-use sector, residents and transport are the most evident sectors studied. China, the United States, and Europe are the most featured regions while very few studies focus on Africa, South America, and Small Island Developing States. Current research topics concentrate on how to maximize the co-benefit of greenhouse gas mitigation and eco-environment protection via cost-benefit reinventions of energy systems. Discussions of technological innovation are grounded in optimal technology portfolio deployment and cost reduction potential, along with financial and political incentives."
,,,"This paper adds a government subsidy variable to expand the WWY (Wang, C., Wang, N., Yang, J., 2012) model, which is a three-stage entrepreneurial dynamic partial equilibrium model and a useful theoretical tool to analyze entrepreneurial realities after government intervention factors are considered. We analyze the productivity shock and market portfolio risk, endogenous entry and exit, investment, consumption, enterprise value and so on, using 15 parameters and 21 variables. The paper explains the present hi-tech entrepreneurial competitive advantage of US, even Chinese government provides lump sum financial subsidy. Although subsidies lower the initial entrepreneurial condition, significantly increase the number of startups, but would not improve entrepreneurial quality such as the investment and the growth of the hi-tech entrepreneurial wealth. The ongoing market deepening reforms such as IPO reform and venture capital cooperation will finally improve model parameters of China and weaken USâ€™s advantage. Another conclusion is that debt-based entrepreneurship should not be encouraged. The conclusions will have some important policy significance."
,,,"Research on medical practice that uses big data has attracted considerable attention recently. In this paper, we focused on a large set of patient referral data gathered in Fujian province, China, between 2009 and 2011. We built a directed weighted patient referral network. By using four metrics from network science, namely, the power-law distribution, global rich-club coefficient, local rich-club coefficient, and assortativity coefficient, we identified a significant rich-club phenomenon in this network. In addition, the community detection was also carried out to find the relationship between rich members and non-rich members. The findings indicate an oligopoly in which Class-III hospitals occupy an overwhelmingly dominant position over the competition. Also, the characteristic â€˜significant regional clusteringâ€™ was inferred from the results."
,,,"The global transition to a low-carbon economy will involve changes in material markets and supply chains on a hitherto unknown scale and scope. With these changes come numerous challenges and opportunities related to supply chain security and sustainability. To help support decision-making as well as future research, this study employs a problem-oriented perspective while reviewing academic publications, technical reports, legal documents, and published industry data to highlight the increasingly interconnected nature of material needs and geopolitical change. The paper considers a broad set of issues including technologies, material supplies, investment strategies, communal concerns, innovations, modeling considerations, and policy trends to help contextualize policy decisions and regulatory responses. Policy options are outlined for each topical section, as well as areas for further research. Together, these recommendations serve to help guide the complex, interdisciplinary approach to materials required for a low-carbon transition."
,,,"Waste sorting at the source is a vital strategy of waste management and to improve urban sustainability. If the strategy is implemented by relying solely on publicity and civic awareness, the impact is less significant. Proactive measures, such as policy regulations, supervisory guidance, and stimulating incentives, play essential roles for better management. The unknown waste-dumping behaviour of residents is a great challenge for decision-makers to allocate resources for waste-collection operations and to refine regulations. Traditional behaviour analysis methods such as questionnaire surveys and simulation methods have limitations considering the population size and the complexity of individual behaviour. This study aims to design a data-driven analytical framework to analyse household waste-dumping behaviour and facilitate policy regulations by using the Internet of Things (IoT) and data mining technologies. The analytical framework is further developed into a four-step management cycle. A case study in Shanghai is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the analytical framework and management cycle. The results of behaviour analyses reveal that (1) waste-dumping frequency is high in the evening but negligible in the early afternoon; (2) compared to working days, peak-value time at weekends occurs later in the morning and earlier in the evening; (3) residents require longer waste-dumping time windows than those empirically recommended by administrators. Managerial insights and decision support based on these research results have been presented for decision-makers to guide operations management and facilitate policy regulations."
,,,"The decreasing cost of energy storage and increasing demand for local flexibility are opening up new possibilities for energy storage deployment at the local level. Community energy storage (CES) is expected to contribute positively towards energy transition while accommodating the needs and expectations of citizens and local communities. Yet, the technological and societal challenges of integrating CES in the largely centralized present energy system demand for socio-technical innovation. In this article, we develop and discuss several configurations of CES. Applying system innovation and socio-technical transition frameworks and conceptualizing CES as a complex socio-technical system, different dynamics of CES in the energy systems such as coordination and interaction among actors and components of CES and the larger energy system is explored. The responsible research and innovation (RRI) framework can provide a new discourse in design and implementation of CES, facilitating the transition to a sustainable, reliable, inclusive and affordable future energy system."
,,,"International firmsâ€™ activities and structures have become highly complex as a result of managing a vast network of entities located around the world. Complex technology such as Additive Manufacturing or generally accepted as 3D printing has received universal interest. Economic growth in Vietnam generates unique infrastructure, logistics services and transportation challenges and opportunities. Logistics are a critically important priority in international trade, foremost in ongoing regional economic expansion. The main objective of this paper is to examine the impact and benefits of advanced technology, affecting logistics services and transportation in Vietnam. This research applied a descriptive survey methodology to gather primary empirical data on the awareness and the willingness to adapt to the technology of organizations focusing on opportunities for the Vietnam market. The results indicated that organizations have a positive attitude towards 3DP impact. The stronger influence was discovered on customization, new customer value proposition, the competitive advantage, and transportation and storage cost reduction. Vietnam is currently one of the most attractive emerging markets in the world. The findings from this research provide timely and valuable new insights into this phenomenon, as a potential mechanism for assisting the revolution of the transportation industry towards improving traffic congestion and pollution."
,,,"This study investigates the effects of information technology (IT) identity on the use of personal health devices (PHDs). We conducted an online survey of individuals who used a PHD to achieve a health-related goal. The results confirm that IT identity is a multidimensional construct with three reflective dimensions. The results exhibit that the identity verification process (IT characterizes through IT experience) fosters IT identity, which, in turn, encourages individuals to engage in beneficial post-adoption behaviors such as feature use and enhanced use. The findings also reveal that perceived health status moderates the relationship between IT identity and positive use behaviors."
,,,"Advertisement is critical in luxury fashion supply chains. In this paper, we analytically explore the optimal advertisement budget allocation strategy and coordination challenge when there are multiple brand-tier products in the market. In the basic model, we focus our analyses with respect to different risk attitudes that the luxury fashion brand takes and the coordination mechanisms. We show that irrespective of risk attitudes of the luxury fashion brand, the optimal advertisement strategy is a polarized strategy. We derive the coordination mechanisms to overcome the double marginalization effect for each risk attitude case. In the extended model, with the market share considerations, the optimal advertisement strategy is derived and is shown to be no longer polarized in general."

,,,"This article presents an analysis of some smart cities worldwide, similarly shows in detail the concepts of artificial intelligence, governance and governance with the continuous support of the population, through various methodologies that try to meet the needs of the community in various fields such as the economic, mobility and the environment where they live. The city of BogotÃ¡ located in Colombia will be exposed as a specific case, where the respective technological achievements obtained in recent years will be shown to approach what should be an intelligent city, the faults that it has at the transportation level that is a great challenge for generated traffic jams and their possible solution through supervised neural networks, generating a simulation in the Road traffic simulator application for the data, likewise taking advantage of the approach that is being generated to make a transition in the traffic light of the city from incandescent bulbs to LED luminaire, which generates a lower consumption of electricity and a wide range of possibilities with respect to the internal control that can be given, to optimize traffic in the city and thus provide a solution to people who want a shorter time for your daily trips, the main motivation for the creation of this document is the proposal of a method with artificial intelligence that helps to improve the traffic flow of the city, since BogotÃ¡ is one of the cities with the most traffic in the world, as a result a rigorous evaluation of different neuronal architectures will be shown to alleviate the congestion of some streets of the city."
,,,"Cryptocurrencies represent a novel method of exchange without physical form, created by the internet to facilitate in making online payments which potentially bring revolution in the social structure of the future economic system. The core objective of this empirical inquiry is to look into the adoption of cryptocurrencies particularly Bitcoin, among the people of mainland China. To carry out the goals, this study was conducted to collect the essential information by applying a structured questionnaire from the people of mainland China via the online data collection system. The sample size is (nâ€¯=â€¯376) therefore, descriptive statistics, and structural equation modeling (SEM) has been applied to explore the causal relationship between explanatory factors and citizens intention to use. This study proposes that awareness and perceived trustworthiness are comparatively significant factors to determine the intention to use Bitcoin, while perceived usefulness partially mediates the relationship between perceived ease of use and intention to use. This study explores the factors influencing Bitcoin adoption in China demonstrating similarities and differences in terms of global adoption. The outcomes contribute to existing theories of Bitcoin adoption, providing policymakers with insight into how adoption is unfolding in this context."
,,,"With engineering studentsâ€™ attention spans diminishing and the Internet challenging the knowledge resource of faculty it is time to innovate new methods in the teaching â€“ learning process of the Indian Engineering Education. Most of the spaces designed by Architects now called â€œSmart Class Roomsâ€ have 24/7 access to the Internet and a projector that can help us access and share knowledge with students just working smartly from our laptops. This paper concentrates on high tech architectural disruptions yet sustainable solutions to be brought into traditional smart classrooms teaching and Innovation Design Lab experiences to make it more vibrant, participative and innovative. Architecture, the creative science of place making will be conceived not to just satisfy the spatial, visual and functional requirements of the students and faculties using the classroom and labs as it does now but will also be conceptualized using Architectural Technology, AR & VR technologies. While we focus on Technology driven methods we also propose to enhance the CDOI model of Curriculum development (Conceive, Design, Implement and Operate) that is currently gaining acceptance globally and seems to be the future of Engineering Education too. The paper also explores the reality of â€œDeSchoolingâ€ the Indian Engineering education in the 21 stCentury."
,,,"Supply chain finance (SCF) as an effective method for improving supply chain (SC) financial performance has attracted attention from both academics and industries in recent years. In the development of SCF research and practice, there is growing interest in how SCF solutions help to promote SC sustainability performance. However, the research on sustainable SCF (SSCF) remains scant; both scholars and managers have not fully realized the significant economic, environmental, and social value behind this concept. This study, based on a systematic literature review of 47 articles related to SCF and sustainability, summarizes SSCF motives, practices and outcomes. In addition, to further investigate this emerging topic, this review discusses how SSCF solutions may help to drive sustainable SC enablers as well as mitigate sustainable SC barriers, which, in turn, improves sustainable SC performance. Based on the descriptive and thematic findings, this review then develops a conceptual framework that facilitates the conceptual development of SSCF. Finally, it identifies gaps in the existing literature and provides recommendations for future research."
,,,"The concept of industry 4.0 (i4.0) encompasses the integration of different technologies into an autonomous, knowledge- and sensor-based, self-regulating production system. Our objective is to synthesize which are the challenges and opportunities of adopting i4.0 from the perspective of technology provider companies. A single-case research was conducted with ten companies at the Portuguese Production Technologies Cluster. Based on i4.0 technologies â€“ Augmented reality; Additive Manufacturing; Big Data; Cloud Computing; Cyber-Physical Systems; Cybersecurity; Smart Robotics; Simulation; and System Integration â€“ interviewees mentioned that the main adoption challenges are the analysis of data generated, integration of new technologies with available equipment and workforce, and computational limitations. The main opportunities are improvements in: efficiency; flexibility; productivity; cybersecurity; quality of products and services; and decision process due to data analysis. Interviewees have also foreseen changes in company's business model through the integration of internal resources with complementary activities of their partners and other cluster companies."
,,,"Until recently, customers bought all kWhs they used from the network and paid volumetrically based on bundled regulated tariffs. This is beginning to change as some consumers generate some or virtually all their kWhs from rooftop PV panels. Moreover, rapid technological advancements make it possible for prosumers to become prosumagers by adding storage and/or engage in other forms of transactions with and among each other. Such peer-to-peer trading is likely to proliferate as regulators relax the prevailing restrictions. Even more consequential, however, is the emergence of smart intermediaries who can aggregate large numbers of behind-the-meter assets and monitor and optimize the entire portfolio."
,,,"The chapter explores the landscape of microfinance institutions and the informal finance sector in Africa as well as the regulatory environment. It also discusses the phenomenon of microinsurance, which though nascent in Africa is on the rise. Mobile money is also discussed as one component of microfinance, which is growing by leaps and bounds throughout Africa, having first taken root in East Africa. Lastly, the chapter peers into the future of microfinance institutions in light of technological developments."
,,,"Regulatory technology or â€˜RegTechâ€™ is the use of technology, particularly information technology, in the context of regulatory monitoring, reporting and compliance. RegTech to date has focused on the digitization of manual reporting and compliance processes, for example in the context of know-your-customer requirements. This offers tremendous cost savings to the financial services industry and regulators. However, the potential of RegTech is far greater â€“ it could enable close to real-time monitoring and a proportionate regulatory regime that addresses risk and facilitates more efficient regulatory compliance. We argue that the transformative nature of technology will only be captured by a new approach that sits at the nexus between data, digital identity, and regulation. We seek to expose the inadequacy and lack of ambition of simply digitizing analogue processes in a digital financial world. The development of financial technology (â€˜FinTechâ€™), rapid developments in emerging markets, and the recent pro-active stance of regulators in developing regulatory sandboxes, represent a unique combination of events, which could facilitate the transition from one regulatory model to another."
,,,"The Convention on Biological Diversity and its supplementary agreement the Nagoya Protocol, the International Treaty for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture and the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework all establish schemes for access and benefit sharing (ABS) biological materials. A key contentious and unresolved question is how to deal with information like digital sequence information (DSI) â€“ a placeholder term for genetic information about biological materials. The same issues are under consideration at the negotiation of an ABS scheme for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction in the international legally binding instrument under the Convention on the Law of the Sea. If DSI is to be addressed and included in this ABS scheme, then the essential choices available to negotiators are: (1) To consider DSI is already included within the current definitions of genetic resources; (2) Expressly include DSI within the definition of (marine) genetic resources; (3) Include DSI as a derivative of (marine) genetic resources; or (4) Seek alternative ways to compensate for DSI not being a resource. The article concludes that including information like DSI within the ABS transaction challenges the current practices of science research with detrimental consequences for the progress of open science, and that now would be a good time to reconsider alternative ways to deliver benefits."

,,,"The disruptive innovation theory, proposed and developed by Christensen over 20 years ago, has been widely discussed and applied. However, there are still serious misunderstanding and misusing of the concept and connotation of disruptive innovation. Doubts about its practical significance and predictability also remain. In this paper, we attempt to further clarify the concept and emphasize its important role in guidance in practices through reviewing relevant literatures published in SSCI journals. Furthermore, we propose a multilevel theoretical framework to examine the influence factors of disruptive innovation by integrating various research results. We also provide suggestions and implications for future research."
,,,"This study reviews the presence of articles related to Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) in Web of Science (WOS). Bibliometric analysis first reveals the trends of CEE-related articles in the areas of international business (IB), management and economics up to 2016. The results show steady growth in absolute and relative numbers after 1990, intensifying since 2010. Second, we conduct topic research using network analysis with blockmodeling. We identify a network of topics and their interrelations over time and used them to periodise the CEE-related research in IB. The most-cited CEE-related IB articles and the main citation path are also presented. The analysis adds to the discussion of how the CEE region is explored in IB research, its contributions, impacts and the challenges facing regional research in the future. In this study, a methodology and framework for performing a comprehensive bibliometric analysis on regional IB research is applied."
,,,"The Generation Expansion Planning (GEP) stands as one as one of the most discussed topics within the academia and decision makers in the energy sector, especially related to meeting deep emission reduction targets. Every country, aiming at decarbonizing its economy, focuses on the application of policies that could enhance the penetration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) in its power capacity mix. GEP is a complex task, combining techno-economic, financial, spatial and environmental characteristics. Several models are developed to model GEP, applying different methodological approaches. The underlying theory is very important as it might inherit bias in the resulted outcomes. The debate on the appropriateness of each methodology is increased, especially as projected outlooks deviate from reality. The paper aims to provide a review of the models employed to integrate RES in the GEP. The paper classifies models in three generic categories: optimisation models, general/partial equilibrium models and alternative models, not adopting the optimum integration of RES in the GEP. It provides insights on the characteristics, advantages and disadvantages of the theoretical approaches implemented, as well on their suitability for different aspects of the problem, contributing in the better understanding on the expected outcomes of each methodology."
,,,"Falsified medical products have become a global threat since they were first mentioned to the general public at the conference of experts on the rational use of drugs organized by the world health organization (WHO) in 1985. Today, official estimates of the annual death toll due to falsified medical products range between two hundred thousand and one million. Although the extent of this global problem is the most significant in the developing world, an increasing number of reports have demonstrated the presence of a substantial (black) market for falsified medical products in the developed world. In recent years, also biotechnology drugs (synthetic peptide drugs and protein drugs) have been reported to be prone for falsifications. Next to the traditional doping related substances and image-enhancing polypeptides (e.g., human growth hormone, melanotan II) also essential medicines such as insulin, oxytocin and monoclonal antibodies have been falsified. The danger regarding the use of these falsified polypeptide drugs lies in the fact that end-users have no guarantee of the safety and efficacy of these preparations. Multiple reports have namely described the presence of the wrong active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), the wrong dosage or the absence of the API. Additionally, adverse health effects have been reported in the past due to toxic contaminations and product or process related impurities. Moreover, also unauthorized polypeptides or polypeptides which failed clinical trials or are still subject of clinical or pre-clinical assessments have been found in seizures of regulatory agencies. It stands to reason that regulatory agencies and analytical laboratories handling falsified biotechnology drugs have stepped up efforts to counter these grievous practices. The analysis of these falsified polypeptides and putative impurities is however not always straightforward. Often (bio)analytical laboratories have to resort to a combination of electrophoretic techniques, immunological assays and mass spectrometry based approaches to merely identify the content of seized samples. In addition, the difference in size (peptide vs proteins vs monoclonal antibodies), complexity (e.g., isoforms, glycosylations) and different synthesis techniques (chemical synthesis, recombinant expression, native protein isolation) result in a wide range of putative health risks. This review therefore aims to provide a brief overview of the genuine biotherapeutics present on the market and their quality prerequisites. Next, we describe the identification strategy utilised by our lab to identify the API in falsified biotherapeutics, followed by a discussion of the putative hazards due to impurities and contaminations that were found or could be encountered in falsified biotherapeutics. Finally, we terminate with an educational prediction of what may happen in the future and possible ways to counteract putative future disasters."
,,,"We present a Strengths, Vulnerability, and Intervention Assessment related to Digital Threats (SVIDT) method, which provides a problem structuring and decision support for organizational vulnerability and resilience management with respect to changes of the digital transition. The method starts from (i) a multi-level actor analysis, (ii) identifies strengths and weaknesses of organizations, (iii) constructs digital threat scenarios and provides judgment-based expert assessments on the organization's vulnerability, (iv) develops intervention scenarios for tangible threat scenarios, and (v) suggests win-win action scenarios when referring to the multi actor system analysis as for strategic management. A first validation and application includes a structural analysis of the response patterns and a quantitative and qualitative appraisal of the organizationsâ€™ managers. This validation is based on an application of the method to 18 German and Austrian organizations of different types and magnitude. We show how the basic concepts of vulnerability (i.e., sensitivity, exposure adaptive capacity) can be quantitatively operationalized when constructing consistent combinations of threat and intervention scenarios. The validation approaches indicate that the method provides meaningful data and assessments and that the managers provided a positive feedback on the method and the recommendations which they received. It is further deliberated whether the assessment method supports organizationsâ€™ specified resilience management in an overly complex, systemic digital transition in a (semi) quantitative manner. In addition, we discuss needs for future research regarding practical utility of SVIDT, as well as the positioning of SVIDT in relation to soft operational methods and other methods of operational research."
,,,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of exchange rate depreciations and appreciations on the tourism trade balance. Specifically, we employed linear and nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) cointegration techniques to analyze the extent to which currency depreciations and appreciations affect the United States (U.S.) bilateral tourism trade with Canada, Mexico, and the United Kingdom (U.K.). The results showed that the depreciation of the U.S. dollar subsequently improves the U.S. trade balance with all three trading partners. However, while the appreciation of the U.S. dollar deteriorates the U.S. bilateral tourism trade balance with Canada and the U.K., it does not ultimately affect the U.S. bilateral tourism trade with Mexico in the long term. These results provide evidence contradicting the J-curve theory, supporting the postulations of the ML condition. Theoretical and policy implications are discussed within the realms of J-curve theory, Marshall-Lerner (ML) condition, international trade, and tourism."
,,,"Sustainable business model innovation is increasingly viewed as a lever for systems change for sustainability across businesses and industries. Banks hold a unique intermediary role in sustainable development, but also have a difficult position after the 2008 financial crisis. This paper aims to explore business models for sustainability in the service industry, particularly banking. It explores the receptiveness of customers towards sustainable business models pursued by banks. The retail banking industry in Hong Kong is the focus of this work. First, a practice review and semi-structured interviews are used to develop and validate a set of sustainable business model archetypes for the banking industry. Second, surveys are conducted to test customer receptiveness for the archetypes. Eight sustainable business model archetypes for banking are developed and validated. â€œSubstitute with digital processesâ€, â€œadopt a stewardship roleâ€ and â€œencourage sufficiencyâ€ are most welcomed by customers. Some archetypes seem at direct odds with current business practice, such as â€œencourage sufficiencyâ€. This study gives an insight to how to â€œdo good and do wellâ€ in the banking industry. Further research on the attributes of these archetypes can be conducted to gain a deeper understanding why customers prefer banks to use these archetypes."
,,,"Growing adoption of the right to information in Africa should, in theory, improve access to government data, reduce corruption and expand the frontiers of democracy. Yet studies demonstrate that the right to information has contributed little if not nothing to improve the fledgling democracy in Africa. This paper investigates whether the implementation of the Right To Information law in Africa is a paradox? The paper contends that that corruption, human rights abuses, restrictive media, absence of media pluralism, denial of access to information, lack of transparency and accountability continue to undermine the very ideals of Right To Information Law. To resolve this paradox, the paper argues that the passage of the right to information is just one of the democratic tests to a country and will require far more than a passage to ensure its success. It argues that making information available will not prevent corruption if the conditions for publicity and accountability are weak. The paper contends that the RTI is dependent on a number of factors which may take long period to have an impact. Political leadership, civil society involvement and a balancing act that would address both access to government records and the protection of individual privacy are possibly the cure to this growing paradox."
,,,"Bill Gates projected that, â€œBy 2030, 2 billion people who don't have a bank account today will be storing money and making payment with their phonesâ€ as a mega trend of digital financial inclusion. This paper contributes to the literature on digital financial inclusion in surveying the current status of such inclusion in South East Asia. While there is no universally accepted definition nor measure of financial inclusion, the paper employs the G20 Financial Inclusion Indicators and the theoretical digital financial inclusion development pathway framework of Radcliffe and Voorhies (2012) to (a) survey the current financial inclusion status, (b) the effectiveness of government initiatives to deliver financial services and (c) examine possible development pathways for the South East Asian (SEA) nations towards financial inclusion. Our analysis of data from 2011 to 2014 from the Global Findex database finds wide differences in banking account penetration rate among adults, stage of development of banking sectors' infrastructure, and the use of banking-technology among the SEA nations. Resulting from the survey and our analysis of the initiators of core connectivity (being mainly the stage of economic development), we conclude that it is highly likely that digital financial inclusion in countries like Cambodia and Myanmar will be driven by mobile network operators, who would provide a full slate of financial services. On the other hand, the other SEA nations are projected to develop mobile banking services for the unbanked by the partnership of the banking and mobile network operators."
,,,"The circular economy (CE) concept is much-heralded among policy-makers, scholars and industry professionals as an accelerated pathway towards sustainability. This move away from the dominant linear system where products are discarded at the end of product lifecycle is deemed necessary since it is the main cause of an accelerated resource consumption. Business models are considered as a key enabler for the shift from a linear to a CE. However, research on circular business models has mainly focused on circular approaches adopted by incumbent firms, while the contributions of newly established firms (the authors call these â€™circular start-upsâ€™) have been largely overlooked. This article scrutinises the business models of circular start-ups and how they may differ from those of incumbent firms embracing CE. For this, it analyses the circular business model strategies and innovations adopted by circular start-ups, relying on a novel data sample of 128 circular start-ups identified in three major CE ecosystems in Europe: the Randstad region in the Netherlands, Berlin and London. Based on this data, a novel typology of circular start-ups is proposed, distinguishing between five circular start-up archetypes: design-based, waste-based, platform-based, service-based and nature-based start-ups. The results also show that circular start-ups tend to embrace strategies corresponding to higher levels of circularity than those of incumbents. This preliminarily suggests that circular start-ups can indeed make major contributions to transitioning towards CE."
,,,"Using a large representative sample of retailers active in e-commerce, we find that acceptance of crypto-payments is modest (2%), but there is substantial interest among online retailers to adopt them. Regression analysis shows that consumer demand, net transactional benefits and perceived accessibility of accepting crypto-payments influence adoption intention and actual acceptance. Our findings also suggest that service providers who act as intermediaries in e-commerce play a crucial role as facilitators of competition and innovation by increasing accessibility. The most serious barrier for crypto-acceptance is a lack of consumer demand. It seems therefore unlikely that crypto adoption by online retailers will increase substantially in the near future."
,,,"This study examines the asymmetric volatility connectedness between Bitcoin and major precious metals markets (gold, silver, palladium, and platinum). We use high-frequency data with methodologies introduced by Diebold and Yilmaz (2014) and BarunÃ­k, KoÄcenda, and VÃ¡cha (2017). The results show evidence of significant volatility spillover effects between Bitcoin and precious metals. Moreover, the risk spillovers vary over time and are sensitive to slowdowns in economic activity and political events (e.g., the Brexit vote and the US presidential election). Palladium is the largest net contributor of spillovers while Bitcoin is a net recipient. Finally, evidence of asymmetry in semi-volatility transmission shows that Bitcoin heavily transmits net-positive spillovers to other assets. The results of our research are of interest and importance to investors, portfolio managers, and policy-makers, as the results can readily inform their decision-making."
,,,"The identification of crime series is of great importance for public safety in a smart city development. This research presents a novel crime clustering model, CriClust+, for detecting Crime Series Pattern (CSP). The analysis is augmented using geometric projection with a dual-threshold model. The pattern prevalence information extracted from the model is encoded in similarity graphs. Clusters are identified by finding highly-connected subgraphs using adaptive graph size and Monte-Carlo heuristics in the Kargerâ€“Stein mincut algorithm. We propose two new interest measures: (i) Proportion Difference Evaluation (PDE), which reveals the propagation effect of a series and dominant series; and (ii) Pattern Space Enumeration (PSE), which reveals strong underlying correlations and defining features for a series. Our findings on experimental dataset based on a Gaussian distribution and expert knowledge recommendation reveal that, identifying CSP and statistically interpretable patterns could contribute significantly to strengthening public safety service delivery. Evaluation was conducted to investigate: (i) the reliability of the model in identifying all inherent series in a crime dataset; (ii) the scalability of the model with varying crime records volume; and (iii) unique features of the model compared to related research. The study also found that PDE and PSE of series clusters can provide valuable insight into crime deterrence strategies. This research presents considerable empirical evidence, which shows that the proposed crime clustering (CriClust+) model is promising and can assist in deriving useful crime pattern knowledge."
,,,"This paper brings together several contemporary topics in energy systems aiming to provide a literature review based reflection on how several interrelated energy systems can contribute together to a more sustainable world. Some directions are discussed, such as the improvement of the energy efficiency and environmental performance of systems, the development of new technologies, the increase of the use of renewable energy sources, the promotion of holistic and multidisciplinary studies, and the implementation of new management rules and ""eco-friendly and sustainable"" oriented policies at different scales. The interrelations of the diverse energy systems are also discussed in order to address their main social, economic and environmental impacts. The subjects covered include the assessment of the electricity market and its main players (demand, supply, distribution), the evaluation of urban systems (buildings, transportation, commuting), the analysis of the implementation of renewable energy cooperatives, the discussion of the diffusion of the electric vehicle and the importance of new bioenergy systems. This paper also presents relevant research carried out in the framework of the Energy for Sustainability (EfS) Initiative of the University of Coimbra, linking the reviewed areas to the multidisciplinary approach adopted by the EfS Initiative. To conclude, several research topics that should be addressed in the near future are proposed."
,,,"This chapter examines the relationships between information and communication technologies and various aspects of financial development in Europe. After the presentation of the variables, a purely empirical analysis is conducted. The second part of the chapter considers the impact of ICT on the financial system at large and on particular segments, such as banking. The third and fourth parts of the chapter examine the role of ICT in the evolution of financial markets, especially stock markets. Finally, we set out data on the linkage between ICT and financial innovation, using the example of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The period covered is 1990â€“2016. The main research methods used here include country-level development trajectories, local polynomial regressions, and panel models."
,,,"Social media systems have become ubiquitous, despite their relatively recent development. Social media refers to a set of computational tools that support social interaction between users. They transform â€œone-to-manyâ€ communication to â€œmany-to-manyâ€ communication. Social media systems can be characterized by six main dimensions that make up the social media design framework: Size of producer and consumer population; Pace of interaction; Genre of basic elements; Control of basic elements; Types of connections; Retention of content. Many types of social media systems exist including asynchronous threaded conversation, synchronous conversation, World Wide Web, collaborative authoring, blogs and podcasts, social sharing, social networking services, online markets and production, idea generation, virtual worlds, and mobile services. Contemporary and historical examples of these social media genres are described, along with examples of the types of connections that are embedded within them."

This paper summarizes the panelistsâ€™ prepared remarks.
,,,"Commercializing an emerging technology that employs an immature production process can be challenging, particularly when there are many different sources of uncertainty. In industries with stringent safety requirements, regulatory interventions that ensure safety while maintaining incentives for innovation can be particularly elusive. We use the extreme case of metal additive manufacturing (an emerging technology with many sources of process uncertainty) in commercial aviation (an industry where lapses in safety can have catastrophic consequences) to unpack how the characteristics of a technology may influence the options for regulatory intervention. Based on our findings, we propose an adaptive regulatory framework in which standards are periodically revised and in which different groups of companies are regulated differently as a function of their technological capabilities. We conclude by proposing a generalizable framework for regulating emerging process-based technologies in safety-critical industries in which the optimal regulatory configuration depends on the industry structure (number of firms), the performance and safety requirements, and the sources of technological uncertainty."
,,,"The relevance of energy efficiency policy measures for renewable-rich countries could be different from those countries that have a limited share of renewables in their electricity generation mix, and are therefore likely to focus on low-carbon energy generation policies. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the energy efficiency initiatives of the three highest renewable-rich OECD countries, namely: Iceland, Norway and New Zealand. The paper then focuses on a comprehensive review of New Zealand's energy efficiency policies since a formal â€œEnergy Efficiency and Conservation Actâ€ came into force. This paper then highlights the future challenges for New Zealand and offers some policy recommendations, which may also be applicable for other renewable-rich countries."

,,,"Fintech holds boundless potential in the context of social inclusion. As new platforms and technologies are introduced to the market, and the boundaries of traditional business models are challenged, financial services can be provided with greater accountability, efficiency and accessibility. Ant Financial, China's largest Fintech company in the making, is set to revolutionize the China's financial network, including payment, wealth management and loans. It focuses on the underserved markets by the major Chinese banks: the low-income individuals, especially those in the rural areas. Ant Financial has leveraged on Taobao's platform, along with Alibaba's rural Taobao Strategy, to give out loans and help traditional agricultural business to set up shops on Taobao. Alibaba also introduced Taobao rural service centers, where villagers can get accustomed to making purchases and paying bills online, as well as picking up items they bought on Taobao. Alibaba provides computers and trains villagers to serve as its representatives in the centers, which are often in convenience stores. With Fintech advancements, access to products and financial services is becoming more accessible than ever. Ensuring a level playing field for consumers that live in rural locations or regions without the structures of an urban economy is vital in achieving full financial and social inclusion."
,,,"Online Crisis Mapping Systems (CMS) are de facto tools to facilitate disaster response, although they may fail to work during the initial days of large-scale (Level 3) natural disasters, because of the unavailability of Internet due to the breakdown of existing communication infrastructures and the power-grids. In this paper, we present a novel end-to-end application system, called CRIMP, which can run both as an Android App in users' smartphones as well as an application in custom portable units, referred as Information Storage Boxes (ISB) which are designed as networking building-blocks to combat network-outage after large-scale disasters. In the absence of Internet, it leverages (a) the presence of active smartphone users as crisis mappers, (b) inherent mobility of rescue vehicles as data mules, and (c) presence of few pre-deployed ISBs in a disaster-hit locality. CRIMP creates a Wi-Fi ad-hoc network to opportunistically aggregate captured information, processes it, and finally embeds it on maps to generate semi-real-time â€˜Local Crisis Mapâ€™ (LCM) in a decentralized way. It considers issues unique to an offline crisis mapping system and implements a channel-sensed, hands-free, scalable, ad-hoc connectivity among devices in proximity for â€˜role-basedâ€™ seamless syncing of situational messages, addressing the â€˜consistency-coverage-quality trade-offâ€™. Extensive lab-scale testing and analysis from some field-level mock drills reveal that CRIMP can speed-up the need assessment and emergency response in time-sensitive situations."
,,,"The challenge of income inequality is widely recognized as the burning issue of our times, and its political consequences are dramatically highlighted recently by Brexit and the victory of Donald Trump in the US election. Depending on how this challenge is understood, however, the solutions could vary dramatically. At one end of the spectrum, the market economy is perceived as having failed to spread equitably the fruits of economic growth, hence more aggressive government interventions, including income redistribution, are needed. At the opposite end, inept governments, counter-productive and anti-market public policies are to be blamed, and it follows that unshackling market forces will lead to improving income equality."
,,,"Fluctuating and extreme weather patterns are acute indicators of climate change and these patterns modify tourist activities. The tourism industry is thus considered highly vulnerable to climate change. However, the effects of climate change on tourism have not yet been extensively quantified. Furthermore, the extent to which tourism is vulnerable or resilient to climate change has not been compared to other sectors of the economy. This study examines the extent to which vulnerability and resilience to climate change affect tourism and the overall economy. The results indicate the effects of vulnerability are much greater than those of resilience. The tourism industry is more vulnerable, yet more resilient, to climate change compared to the overall economy. The strength of these effects varies across countries with different income levels: countries with the lowest income levels are more vulnerable and less resilient, and those with the highest income are the least vulnerable and most resilient."
,,,"With the arrival of Industry 4.0, the overall transformation using digital integration and intelligent engineering has taken a giant leap towards futuristic technology. All devices today are equipped with machine learning, automation has become a priority and thus another industrial revolution is in the making. In this state-of-the-art paper, we have performed bibliometric analysis and an extensive survey on recent developments in the field of â€œIndustry 4.0â€. In bibliometric analysis, different performance metrics are extracted, such as: total papers, total citations, and citation per paper. Further, top 10 of the most productive and highly cited authors, major subject areas, sources or journals, countries, and institutions are evaluated. A list of highly influential papers is also assessed. Later on, a detailed discussion of the most cited papers is analysed and a sectional classification is provided. This paper summarizes the growth structure of Industry 4.0 during the last 5 years and provides the concise background overview of Industry 4.0 related works and various application areas."
,,,"In todayâ€™s increasingly interconnected world, outbreaks of disease or contamination can spread widely and cause considerable impact on public health. Proactively assessing the ability to identify the source of an outbreak in a networked system is a critical step in aiding emergency and operational preparedness management prior to a crisis situation. While many methods have been developed to identify the source of an outbreak once it has occurred, limited research has been devoted to developing measures to assess the overall ability of a network structure to support accurate source identification, which we call traceability. Furthermore, while significant work has focused on understanding the role of network structure on propagation dynamics, its impact on traceability has yet remained unstudied. Here, we introduce a novel, comprehensive measure of network traceability, which calculates the information-theoretic entropy of the posterior probability distribution over feasible sources resulting from inferring the source location. By capturing information about the full posterior probability distribution, this measure presents an improvement over the binary logical outcome of the prediction accuracy metric generally applied to assess source identification method performance. Using food supply chain networks as an example, we use this measure to provide the first study systematically evaluating the role of network structural parameters on traceability, comparing both synthetic networks generated to exhibit a range of structural features known to be relevant to contamination propagation and real networks representing the Chinese pork supply chain across various cities. This analysis yields insights about the relationship between traceability and network structure, some counter-intuitive, and more generally, illustrates how this measure can be used in emergency and operational preparedness to proactively assess network traceability and recommend strategies for its improvement."

,,,"With its rapid growth and increasing adoption, big data is producing a substantial impact in society. Its usage is opening both opportunities such as new business models and economic gains and risks such as privacy violations and discrimination. Europe is in need of a comprehensive strategy to optimise the use of data for a societal benefit and increase the innovation and competitiveness of its productive activities. In this paper, we contribute to the definition of this strategy with a research roadmap to capture the economic, social and ethical, legal and political benefits associated with the use of big data in Europe. The present roadmap considers the positive and negative externalities associated with big data, maps research and innovation topics in the areas of data management, processing, analytics, protection, visualisation, as well as non-technical topics, to the externalities they can tackle, and provides a time frame to address these topics in order to deliver social impact, skills development and standardisation. Finally, it also identifies what sectors will be most benefited by each of the research efforts. The goal of the roadmap is to guide European research efforts to develop a socially responsible big data economy, and to allow stakeholders to identify and meet big data challenges and proceed with a shared understanding of the societal impact, positive and negative externalities and concrete problems worth investigating in future programmes."
,,,"We propose a closed-loop supply chain system that incorporates a trade-in program and refurbishment service simultaneously. Through the trade-in program, retailers collect used old-generation products from customers and provide them with new-generation products at a discount price. It helps to acquire the additional products required for the refurbishment service. The proposed integrated system could be useful to retailers selling the smartphone which has a high potential in emerging markets. We approximate the multistage stochastic optimization model to the robust counterpart which features a second-order cone program. Computational results provide managerial insights that could be beneficial to the retailer."
,,,"This study aims to explore integrated solid waste management hierarchical interrelationships using a sustainable balance scorecard approach. The proposed analysis using the fuzzy Delphi method to exclude invalid attributes, interpretive structural modeling to arrange attributes into an extensive hierarchical model, and using a fuzzy decision-making trial-and-evaluation laboratory to examine the causal interrelationships among attributes. The solid waste management systems in Vietnam are generally inefficient due to a lack of proper administrative oversight, infrastructure, and adequate resource utilization. Integrated solid waste management is an important provision in public service systems. There is a need to propose and evaluate better management approaches to enhance waste process activities and increase sustainable performance. Collected qualitative information is converted into a crisp value for the evaluation process, and the qualitative data stem from the operations. This study measures 6 aspects and 24 criteria. The results showed that financial investment, stakeholder involvement, and innovation capacity are decisive causal aspects in which stakeholder involvement and innovation capacity are interrelated. The cost efficiency, stakeholder collaboration, flexibility/adaptability to environmental changes, availability of local technical skills, and knowledge acquisition and communication technologies are identified as the linkage criteria that present the highest driving and dependence powers to help decision makers achieve better operational performance."

,,,"Circular Economy (CE) and the adoption of its principles globally are more important than ever to sustain the rate of production of goods and services to meet the ever-increasing consumer demand that is burdening the environment and society. This study investigates the adoption of CE principles amongst emerging economies as the challenges faced by these economies are generally different in terms of resource availability, varying government policies and consumer behaviour from those of developed economies. This research presents an empirically validated CE adoption model using a sample of 183 consumer responses. The study highlights the strong influence of factors such as consumer behaviour on the acceptance of remanufactured products and using products as a service to encourage the adoption of CE practices in emerging economies. This research offers businesses, consumers and policy makers insights into measures that have been taken by emerging economies that are in line with CE principles."
,,,"The future social-technical system (STS) of power supply based on renewables depends heavily upon the rapid emergence of Distributed Energy Systems (DES). The prime object of Social Acceptance processes of renewable energy innovation becomes the issue of how to incorporate DES. The realization of this transformation requires the escape from locked-in hierarchy and standardized design of the centralized grid. This review elaborates the advanced conceptualization of Social Acceptance, particularly its socio-political layer. High diffusion of DES in intelligent microgrids leads to polycentricity replacing hierarchy. Therefore, the main object of 'socio-political acceptance' concerns institutional changes replacing hierarchy by co-production within STSs applying DES. Renewables become 'common goods' in such systems, instead of 'private' or 'public' goods. Systems providing 'common goods' like renewables -that are natural resources-show similarities to socialecological systems, the self-governing entities in common pool resources theory. Application of this institutional theory to co-production in DES leads to the following conclusions on socio-political acceptance. Renewables generation, integration, storage, intelligence and demand response require a shift towards co-producing prosumers. Electricity as an economic good must be redefined from commercial private commodity delivered in a public grid towards a co-produced common good. Essential for common prosumer-based DES is the application of peer-to-peer deliverance (P2P). Policy must avoid to interfere in this and also should remove legal obstructions and transaction costs for P2P and coproduction. As space is the prime scarcity factor for DES, prosumers' communities should also be empowered in co-producing land use decisions for construction of their DES infrastructures."
,,,"Energy economy models are central to decision making on energy and climate issues in the 21st century, such as informing the design of deep decarbonisation strategies under the Paris Agreement. Designing policies that are aimed at achieving such radical transitions in the energy system will require ever more in-depth modelling of end-use demand, efficiency and fuel switching, as well as an increasing need for regional, sectoral, and agent disaggregation to capture technological, jurisdictional and policy detail. Building and using these models entails complex trade-offs between the level of detail, the size of the system boundary, and the available computing resources. The availability of data to characterise key energy system sectors and interactions is also a key driver of model structure and parameterisation, and there are many blind spots and design compromises that are caused by data scarcity. We may soon, however, live in a world of data abundance, potentially enabling previously impossible levels of resolution and coverage in energy economy models. But while big data concepts and platforms have already begun to be used in a number of selected energy research applications, their potential to improve or even completely revolutionise energy economy modelling has been almost completely overlooked in the existing literature. In this paper, we explore the challenges and possibilities of this emerging frontier. We identify critical gaps and opportunities for the field, as well as developing foundational concepts for guiding the future application of big data to energy economy modelling, with reference to the existing literature on decision making under uncertainty, scenario analysis and the philosophy of science."
,,,"Digital innovation has radically changed how organisations collaborate and compete. Coupled with this change are new collaborative value creation networks such as digital business ecosystems (DBEs). DBE is a socio-technical network of individuals, organisations and technologies that collectively co-create value. Since the emergence of DBE over a decade ago, there have been limited attempts to critically review and synthesise the body of knowledge presented over the years. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to fill this gap in DBE research by: (1) developing a comprehensive framework that synthesises and provides an overall direction of DBE research; (2) pointing out gaps in DBE literature; and (3) providing future research directions. To address this purpose, we systematically analysed 101 research articles on DBE. The findings provide insightful revelations to address some limitations in the current DBE research. As such, this study makes important contributions and serves as a useful resource for future DBE studies and practice."
,,,"This paper discusses the potential and constraints for using broadband channels and applications to increase financial inclusion. We consider ten different opportunity areas, and each is described with reference to an illustrative prototypical example. The paper draws on experiences in Latin America, though the main themes and lessons are likely to be applicable more broadly."
,,,"The adoption of e-governing practices has revolutionised the administrative machinery of governments worldwide by improving efficiency, transparency, and accountability. Researchers and administrators often aim to identify emerging research fronts and the timeline of the evolution to forecast and implement technology. In this work, we systematically investigate the trajectory of the global evolution and emerging research fronts as well as the prospects for e-governance using citation network analysis. The growth curve fitted to the number of articles published per year shows that the research activities are still in the ascendant phase. We visualise the global main path of the citation network and investigate the patterns to trace the knowledge diffusion path, major milestones, and emerging research fronts. The cluster analysis identifies the major topics of research as administration and information system management, e-governance framework design, efficiency or quality evaluation, and the application of social networks and open data leading to e-democracy. The adoption of open data and social networking for user interactions with government that leads to participatory governance are the emerging research trends. We also identify research that can have a future impact based on network parameters. The results contribute to the literature by setting the focus of future research, and assisting administrators in selecting suitable models and methodologies, and manufacturers with the development of required technical devices suitable for the upcoming phase of symbiosis."
,,,"Sustainability expresses culturally evolving sets of values, norms, morals, civic engagements, governance, markets, and corporate ethics. Sustainable initiatives emerge as necessary adaptations to ceaseless human activities transforming Earth's energy, matter and information into entropy, externalities, and inequalities. The uncertainty and unknown unknowns intrinsic to life's nonlinear dynamic complexities make sustainability forever provisional, and given planetary scale disruptions humans are triggering, sustainability in the Anthropocene should seek the greatest resilience at city scale. Disruptions impact localities more frequently than nations and it is largely up to local citizens to implement antifragile sustainable practices minimizing such occurrences and enabling robust recoveries."
,,,"The explosion of the interest in the industry 4.0 generated a hype on both academia and business: the former is attracted for the opportunities given by the emergence of such a new field, the latter is pulled by incentives and national investment plans. The Industry 4.0 technological field is not new but it is highly heterogeneous (actually it is the aggregation point of more than 30 different fields of the technology). For this reason, many stakeholders feel uncomfortable since they do not master the whole set of technologies, they manifested a lack of knowledge and problems of communication with other domains. Actually such problem is twofold, on one side a common vocabulary that helps domain experts to have a mutual understanding is missing Riel et al. [1], on the other side, an overall standardization effort would be beneficial to integrate existing terminologies in a reference architecture for the Industry 4.0 paradigm Smit et al. [2]. One of the basics for solving this issue is the creation of shared semantic for industry 4.0. The paper has an intermediate goal and focuses on the development of an enriched dictionary of Industry 4.0 enabling technologies, with definitions and links between them in order to help the user in actively surfing the new domains by starting from known elements to reach the most far away from his/her background and knowledge."
,,,"Present day consumers are accustomed to the fast and ubiquitous access to information and services brought about by digitalization. In contrast, electronic payments between bank accounts, even within the same country, can often take more than a day to complete. The reality is that interbank payment systems are a well-entrenched infrastructure and have taken a long time to evolve and mature to its present state. They were originally designed decades ago for specific purpose, at a time that pre-dates mobile technologies. There are limitations to how effectively they can handle present day payment scenarios, even after iterations of costly enhancements and retrofitting. As such, this gives rise to a sudden increase in implementations of interbank real-time retail payment systems over the last decade. These payment systems are not new in concept but are new in scope. They can process account-to-account fund transfers faster than traditional ACH networks, be more scalable than wholesale payment systems, cheaper than card payments and more ubiquitous than closed loop services. However, the implementations of such systems can come at greater complexities and costs especially to the banks. The purpose of this writing is to help the reader gain an insight into how real-time payment systems fit within the interbank retail payment landscape as well as the complexities and challenges in their implementations and design."
,,,"Commons are natural or human-made resources that are managed cooperatively. The guifi.net community network is a successful example of a digital infrastructure, a computer network, managed as an open commons. Inspired by the guifi.net case and its commons governance model, we claim that a computing cloud, another digital infrastructure, can also be managed as an open commons if the appropriate tools are put in place. In this paper, we explore the feasibility and sustainability of community clouds as open commons: open user-driven clouds formed by community-managed computing resources. We propose organising the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) cloud service layers as common-pool resources (CPR) for enabling a sustainable cloud service provision. On this basis, we have outlined a governance framework for community clouds, and we have developed Cloudy, a cloud software stack that comprises a set of tools and components to build and operate community cloud services. Cloudy is tailored to the needs of the guifi.net community network, but it can be adopted by other communities. We have validated the feasibility of community clouds in a deployment in guifi.net of some 60 devices running Cloudy for over two years. To gain insight into the capacity of end-user services to generate enough value and utility to sustain the whole cloud ecosystem, we have developed a file storage application and tested it with a group of 10 guifi.net users. The experimental results and the experience from the action research confirm the feasibility and potential sustainability of the community cloud as an open commons."
,,,"Electromagnetic spectrum for wireless communications is fully allocated by regulatory authorities, but this does not mean that it is fully utilized. Demand for greater capacity and new services requires new regulatory and technical models for spectrum sharing. This paper develops a regulatory model denoted the dynamic policy license. The dynamic policy license combines the assurances to licensees that come from holding a fixed license while maintaining regulatory flexibility. A dynamic policy license is similar to a traditional spectrum license that specifies a bandwidth, power, center frequency, location, and other parameters. However, one or more of these parameters is subject to change by the regulator over time. The allowed changes are restricted by the license to provide assurances and predictability to the licensee. The opportunities and challenges that this presents to both regulators and licensees is described. For instance, the dynamic policy license can be a regulatory tool for more aggressive spectrum sharing."
,,,"With the Internet of Things (IoT) becoming part of our daily life and our environment, we expect rapid growth in the number of connected devices. IoT is expected to connect billions of devices and humans to bring promising advantages for us. With this growth, fog computing, along with its related edge computing paradigms, such as multi-access edge computing (MEC) and cloudlet, are seen as promising solutions for handling the large volume of security-critical and time-sensitive data that is being produced by the IoT. In this paper, we first provide a tutorial on fog computing and its related computing paradigms, including their similarities and differences. Next, we provide a taxonomy of research topics in fog computing, and through a comprehensive survey, we summarize and categorize the efforts on fog computing and its related computing paradigms. Finally, we provide challenges and future directions for research in fog computing."
,,,"Industrial companies are nowadays acting in global production networks (GPNs). A comprehensive scientific overview of those networks is still missing. To close this gap, a framework for designing and operating GPNs is introduced. It structures influencing factors, challenges, enablers and outlines the need for decision support systems. The state of the art in designing and operating GPNs is reviewed. Three trends are identified that help to transform historical grown networks into changeable GPNs with a focused network footprint. In conclusion, a need for future research in forming the production strategy, designing the network footprint and managing the network is given."
,,,"This article describes an epochal review of research literature on practice-oriented digital health ecosystems that have emerged during the period between 1998 and 2018. Practice-orientation refers to efforts that have resulted in positive impact and transformations in the delivery of healthcare. The review is epochal in the sense that there have been 3 major stages of innovation and diffusion in digital health that are identified. The year 1998 was deemed a significant starting point for the literature search because it marked the introduction of the term e-health. The main objective of this review is to track the evolution of digital health and the conspicuous developments in the field - crucial steps to get a grasp of the key issues involving the delivery of healthcare. The article includes a general discussion of these various key issues and sensitizing concepts. The sense-making thus shed some light on the areas of enquiry, which are central to identifying the direction in which the practice of healthcare is headed. These areas of enquiry often referred to as â€˜substantive areasâ€™ in qualitative research terminology, were identified as â€˜electronic medical recordsâ€™, â€˜health cloudâ€™, â€˜data analyticsâ€™, â€˜Internet-enabled devicesâ€™, and other â€˜emerging information technologiesâ€™. The article concludes with a synthesis of key inferences drawn from the epochal review. The digital disruption of healthcare has created necessary conditions for its offering as a global, interoperable service."
,,,"The bitcoin blockchain provides the new ability to securely transact in the transfer of value or data without intermediaries, and is indispensible when the distribution of influence is valuable or preferred over centralized operations. With blockchain technology, the ledger necessary to verify and record identity and asset ownership for transactional access - once the purview of trusted central institutions (development banks, Bretton Woods Institutions, large-scale investment firms, etc.) - is free from the limitations imposed by centralized controls. While a number of old needs now served by these institutions will become obsolete, new blockchain-enabled institutional mechanisms will address a variety of remaining needs more efficiently. New needs will also emerge to be addressed by old, new, and blockchain-refined institutional mechanisms. A continuous iterative process is imperative during such periods of rapid change. Global financial institutions must be responsive to the cultural shift and dynamic societal values accompanying blockchain innovation."
,,,"This chapter describes how mobile technologies are expanding digital financial inclusion, defined as providing access and delivery of basic banking services, savings, lending, insurance and other financial services to everyone in the populationâ€”especially those who live under the poverty line. The World Bank estimates that over 38 percent of adults in the world, or about two billion adults are unbanked, having no access to formal banking services. Financial inclusion helps those unbanked and underbanked bridge the gaps between the physical, digital and psychological use and access to money. In today's digital world, physical cash is rapidly becoming a remnant of traditional societal mores and legacy financial systems that have disadvantaged the unbanked. By combining digital financial tools (such as mobile remittances using blockchain technology) with psychological tools (such as financial education), the unbanked can attain financial services and break out of the poverty cycle."
,,,"This paper considers the potential significance of â€˜clean energy communitiesâ€™ (CECs) in the transformation of the present socio-technical regimes underlying our centralized energy systems, towards a more distributed and decentralized future. It explains the centralized, distributed, and decentralized sub-structures, embedded in current energy systems and energy markets. We analyze long-term dynamics and possible pathways of this transition, and the co-evolution of energy systems and communities, using an exploratory structure, drawing on insights from transition theories, innovation studies, and social network concepts. This includes analysis of the various forms of CECs â€“ including virtual power plants, peer-to-peer trading, microgrids, and community-scale energy projects â€“ emerging in a number of developed and developing jurisdictions, including Australia. This analysis suggests that low-carbon transition pathways will be varied, driven by social, technological, and organizational contexts, and shaped by institutional change processes, and interaction with the existing regime and incumbent actors. Social and technological entrepreneurs, and utilities, operating within an environment increasingly defined by energy consumers, industry groups, and policy actors, will need to be adaptable and innovative in choosing strategic directions, associated investment decisions, establishing appropriate alliances, and acquiring resources, to meet their goals in this low-carbon energy transition."
,,,"This chapter discusses the technical considerations for implementing food safety and quality systems in developing countries considering current and future requirements. It will build on initial discussions in Volumes I and II and present more details on requirements for exporting food products into Europe, the United States of America, Canada and Australasia. It will examine the state of food safety within selected countries in the Far East, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Africa and considerations for exporting from these markets into others. Among the issues to be examined are national food laws, regulatory frameworks, compliance and enforcement, national and regional regulatory cooperation and the role of national and regional regulators in facilitating access to export markets and regional trade alliances. The interaction of trade with food safety, nutrition and food security is explored. The chapter provides overviews of the EU and Australia/New Zealand regulatory environment and focused, detailed overviews of key components of the US FDAâ€™s Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) 2011 and the Safe Foods for Canadians Act 2012. Included are explanations of critical components of FSMA and the SFCA, their implications, as well as possible approaches to compliance for food industry and market access practitioners."
,,,"The disruptive innovation theory, proposed and developed by Christensen over 20 years ago, has been widely discussed and applied. However, there are still serious misunderstanding and misusing of the concept and connotation of disruptive innovation. Doubts about its practical significance and predictability also remain. In this paper, we attempt to further clarify the concept and emphasize its important role in guidance in practices through reviewing relevant literatures published in SSCI journals. Furthermore, we propose a multilevel theoretical framework to examine the influence factors of disruptive innovation by integrating various research results. We also provide suggestions and implications for future research."
,,,"The potential of smart cities in remediating environmental problems in general and waste management, in particular, is an important question that needs to be investigated in academic research. Built on an integrative review of the literature, this study offers insights into the potential of smart cities and connected communities in facilitating waste management efforts. Shortcomings of existing waste management practices are highlighted and a conceptual framework for a centralized waste management system is proposed, where three interconnected elements are discussed: (1) an infrastructure for proper collection of product lifecycle data to facilitate full visibility throughout the entire lifespan of a product, (2) a set of new business models relied on product lifecycle data to prevent waste generation, and (3) an intelligent sensor-based infrastructure for proper upstream waste separation and on-time collection. The proposed framework highlights the value of product lifecycle data in reducing waste and enhancing waste recovery and the need for connecting waste management practices to the whole product life-cycle. An example of the use of tracking and data sharing technologies for investigating the waste management issues has been discussed. Finally, the success factors for implementing the proposed framework and some thoughts on future research directions have been discussed."
,,,"It is paradox that in globalized world more than one third of its population is excluded from formal financial system. The body of evidence suggests that appropriate financial services can help improve household welfare and promote small enterprises. The financial exclusion is attributed to various reasons. Conventional financial system has several inherent limitations which lead to unserved population. Digital currency and mobile technology can spur penetration of financial system partially in unserved population. The evidence shows that high cost for small ticket size financial transaction in conventional financial system makes the transactions unviable. Digital currency and mobile technology can cater the needs of small transaction at affordable cost. It can also help reducing time, more accurately and make faster transactions in bulk. Many emerging economies like India, Brazil, and Nigeria have embarked on mobile technology to overcome financial exclusion. This chapter sheds light on opportunities, challenges, solutions, global experience in floating digital currency, and using mobile technology for financial inclusion."
,,,"Preventive healthcare requires continuous monitoring of the blood pressure (BP) of patients, which is not feasible using conventional methods. Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals can be effectively used for this purpose as there is a physiological relation between the pulse width and BP and can be easily acquired using a wearable PPG sensor. However, developing real-time algorithms for wearable technology is a significant challenge due to various conflicting requirements such as high accuracy, computationally constrained devices, and limited power supply. In this paper, we propose a novel feature set for continuous, real-time identification of abnormal BP. This feature set is obtained by identifying the peaks and valleys in a PPG signal (using a peak detection algorithm), followed by the calculation of rising time, falling time and peak-to-peak distance. The histograms of these times are calculated to form a feature set that can be used for classification of PPG signals into one of the two classes: normal or abnormal BP. No public dataset is available for such study and therefore a prototype is developed to collect PPG signals alongside BP measurements. The proposed feature set shows very good performance with an overall accuracy of approximately 95%. Although the proposed feature set is effective, the significance of individual features varies greatly (validated using significance testing) which led us to perform weighted voting of features for classification by performing autoregressive modeling. Our experiments show that the simplest linear classifiers produce very good results indicating the strength of the proposed feature set. The weighted voting improves the results significantly, producing an overall accuracy of about 98%. Conclusively, the PPG signals can be effectively used to identify BP, and the proposed feature set is efficient and computationally feasible for implementation on standalone devices."
,,,"Despite the usefulness of computer-assisted audit tools and techniques (CAATTs) in increasing audit productivity and reducing costs, their adoption by audit firms is low in developing countries. The aim of this study is to investigate whether organizational and environmental factors can help explain CAATTs adoption in less developed countries, such as Malaysia. The research framework was developed based on the Technology-Organization-Environment framework (TOE). The results reveal that for environmental factors, the complexity of clients' accounting information systems (AIS) and perceived level of support of professional accounting bodies (PABs) affect CAATTs adoption. For organizational factors, firm size, top management commitment and employee IT competency were found to be significant factors. Moreover, firm size partially moderates the influence of clients' AIS complexity on CAATTs adoption. This paper contributes to existing adoption theory by extending our understanding of the impact of factors unique to CAATTs adoption."
,,,"Research conducted in the innovation field lags behind organizationsâ€™ general technological development and innovativeness. Literature that previously depicted innovation types in developed markets is markedly different from progressively publicized emerging market innovation types. While capital-abundant firms tend to engage in respective pioneering and incremental innovation loops, resource-constrained firms and firms in emerging countries may partially free-ride on existing products and services through innovations such as copycat and frugal. To date, there have been no attempts to holistically consolidate product and service innovation types into one overarching typology. Using novel methods of text mining and co-citation analysis, this study systematically maps three decades of product and service innovation scholarship to provide a typology of eight major product and service innovation types. This is further supported by case study analysis to demonstrate how these innovation types fit into the cost vs market novelty matrix. This study is unique in its methodological proposition to systematically review the innovation scholarship of more than 1,400 articles through comprehensive, quantified, and objective methods that offer transparent and reproducible results. The study provides some clarity regarding the classifications and characteristics of the innovation typology."
,,,"This study reviews the presence of articles related to Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) in Web of Science (WOS). Bibliometric analysis first reveals the trends of CEE-related articles in the areas of international business (IB), management and economics up to 2016. The results show steady growth in absolute and relative numbers after 1990, intensifying since 2010. Second, we conduct topic research using network analysis with blockmodeling. We identify a network of topics and their interrelations over time and used them to periodise the CEE-related research in IB. The most-cited CEE-related IB articles and the main citation path are also presented. The analysis adds to the discussion of how the CEE region is explored in IB research, its contributions, impacts and the challenges facing regional research in the future. In this study, a methodology and framework for performing a comprehensive bibliometric analysis on regional IB research is applied."

,,,"Falsified medical products have become a global threat since they were first mentioned to the general public at the conference of experts on the rational use of drugs organized by the world health organization (WHO) in 1985. Today, official estimates of the annual death toll due to falsified medical products range between two hundred thousand and one million. Although the extent of this global problem is the most significant in the developing world, an increasing number of reports have demonstrated the presence of a substantial (black) market for falsified medical products in the developed world. In recent years, also biotechnology drugs (synthetic peptide drugs and protein drugs) have been reported to be prone for falsifications. Next to the traditional doping related substances and image-enhancing polypeptides (e.g., human growth hormone, melanotan II) also essential medicines such as insulin, oxytocin and monoclonal antibodies have been falsified. The danger regarding the use of these falsified polypeptide drugs lies in the fact that end-users have no guarantee of the safety and efficacy of these preparations. Multiple reports have namely described the presence of the wrong active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), the wrong dosage or the absence of the API. Additionally, adverse health effects have been reported in the past due to toxic contaminations and product or process related impurities. Moreover, also unauthorized polypeptides or polypeptides which failed clinical trials or are still subject of clinical or pre-clinical assessments have been found in seizures of regulatory agencies. It stands to reason that regulatory agencies and analytical laboratories handling falsified biotechnology drugs have stepped up efforts to counter these grievous practices. The analysis of these falsified polypeptides and putative impurities is however not always straightforward. Often (bio)analytical laboratories have to resort to a combination of electrophoretic techniques, immunological assays and mass spectrometry based approaches to merely identify the content of seized samples. In addition, the difference in size (peptide vs proteins vs monoclonal antibodies), complexity (e.g., isoforms, glycosylations) and different synthesis techniques (chemical synthesis, recombinant expression, native protein isolation) result in a wide range of putative health risks. This review therefore aims to provide a brief overview of the genuine biotherapeutics present on the market and their quality prerequisites. Next, we describe the identification strategy utilised by our lab to identify the API in falsified biotherapeutics, followed by a discussion of the putative hazards due to impurities and contaminations that were found or could be encountered in falsified biotherapeutics. Finally, we terminate with an educational prediction of what may happen in the future and possible ways to counteract putative future disasters."
,,,"In December 2014, Estonia became the first nation to open its digital borders to enable anyone, anywhere in the world to apply to become an e-Resident. Estonian e-Residency is essentially a commercial initiative. The e-ID issued to Estonian e-Residents enables commercial activities with the public and private sectors. It does not provide citizenship in its traditional sense, and the e-ID provided to e-Residents is not a travel document. However, in many ways it is an international â€˜passportâ€™ to the virtual world. E-Residency is a profound change and the recent announcement that the Estonian government is now partnering with Bitnation to offer a public notary service to Estonian e-Residents based on blockchain technology is of significance. The application of blockchain to e-Residency has the potential to fundamentally change the way identity information is controlled and authenticated. This paper examines the legal, policy, and technical implications of this development."
,,,"Prior to the advent of large interconnected energy systems, community power needs were typically met through the use of small municipal power stations. As networks expanded and large-scale generation became an affordable alternative, the energy needs of most urban populations were largely serviced by centralized, fossil fuel based generation and transmission infrastructure. However, in the past decade, due to the advent of affordable solar and storage technology, this is transitioning to a hybrid model including distributed renewable energy and storage. While many households presently benefit from embedded solar photovoltaic systems, in high-density areas such as cities, this technology is difficult to provide, due to how the multitenanted buildings are governed. Demand for shared energy solutions within communities has seen the emergence of community-owned renewable energy and storage solutions. How these are being deployed depends on the policies that enable them, as well as by new commercial and governance models. This chapter examines commercial and governance models for multitenanted buildings and community owned renewable energy and storage to demonstrate how planning can best be optimized and result in the emergence of citizen utilities."
,,,"The transition to renewables is being driven by cities, as they are where economic growth is happening. The decoupling of fossil fuels from growth in economic activity is shown to have been proceeding rapidly for most of this century, and is analyzed globally in terms of structures and technologies for energy efficiency and for switching to renewable energy. This is examined for the fall in coal and the fall in oil in terms of urban economies across the world. The evidence suggests the changes are based on demand for the structures and technologies that are emerging. The renewable cities revolution can therefore be expected to accelerate."
,,,"We present the results of our eighth annual horizon scan of emerging issues likely to affect global biological diversity, the environment, and conservation efforts in the future. The potential effects of these novel issues might not yet be fully recognized or understood by the global conservation community, and the issues can be regarded as both opportunities and risks. A diverse international team with collective expertise in horizon scanning, science communication, and conservation research, practice, and policy reviewed 100 potential issues and identified 15 that qualified as emerging, with potential substantial global effects. These issues include new developments in energy storage and fuel production, sand extraction, potential solutions to combat coral bleaching and invasive marine species, and blockchain technology."
,,,"This chapter presents an analysis of financial intermediation in cryptocurrency markets with a focus on cryptocurrency exchanges and electronic wallet providers. These two main intermediaries are considered in detail by highlighting the activity, risk profiles and regulation of each service category. This is followed by a brief introduction to other less-regulated intermediation activities operating in this market, namely, cryptocurrency lending platforms, cryptocurrency remittance services and the use of hybrid business models. The chapter concludes by presenting regulatory issues in need of further consideration in the future governance of the cryptocurrency markets. These include the filling in of regulatory gaps and fissures in the areas of peer-to-peer platforms and the resolution of defunct exchanges, and the creation of bridges and linkages between current regulation and alternative sources of law including payment services regulation, custody and authorization law and the fuller consideration of the regulatory implications of existing industry self-regulation."
,,,"Community microgrids implemented in existing electricity grids can meet both development targets set out in the Paris agreement: 1. mitigate greenhouse gas emissions through increased implementation of renewable energy sources, and 2. to adapt to climate related disturbances and risk of catastrophes. Community microgrids are, however, complex to implement and institutional change is needed to reach their full potential. The purpose of this article is to review existing literature and analyze institutional developments influencing the growth of community microgrids. The literature describes a concentration of microgrid activities in specific regions: USA, EU, Asia and Australia. Varying reasons for implementing community microgrids were found in the different regions but similar institutional developments occurred, albeit with differing emphasis due to contextual specificities. Formal directions do however influence informal institutions even though their aims differ. Power utilities stand out as a critical actor and both formal and informal institutions put pressure on utilities to update their traditional business models. This article illustrates how informal and formal institutions play a significant role in the growth of community microgrids in existing electricity grids and provide interesting examples which can be utilized by policymakers. Microgrid development is still in a formative phase and further institutional change in the form of updated regulations is needed."
,,,"In the modern business environment, consumers are increasingly influenced by megatrends involving marketplace, technology, socioeconomics, geopolitics, and natural environment. Simultaneously, the data and insights that can inform consumer attitudes and behaviors often reside outside of firms' direct control. Consciously incorporating these interdependent factors into firms' decision-making is essential for adaptability and sustainable profitability. Building on the â€œoutside-inâ€ perspective, we propose that firm strategies should be informed through the lens of the marketing ecosystem that considers the interrelated and dynamic megatrends. By leveraging advances in data and technology, firms can sense-make the marketplace by extracting insights from massive amounts of diverse consumer data with modern-day analytics. By mapping out the megatrends with marketing analytics, firms can 1) more accurately predict consumers' changing preferences and formulate appropriate strategies to engage with them; and 2) become more market-adaptable and competitive in the present and the future. To deliver sustainably compelling value to customers, firms should adopt an ecosystem mindset and cooperate with various stakeholders. A broad-thinking, agile, and humble firm culture can enable the development of more robust outside-in capabilities. We elaborate on the megatrends in the interconnected world of the marketing ecosystem, and propose emerging research directions in each area."
,,,"Blockchain is an emerging digital technology allowing ubiquitous financial transactions among distributed untrusted parties, without the need of intermediaries such as banks. This article examines the impact of blockchain technology in agriculture and food supply chain, presents existing ongoing projects and initiatives, and discusses overall implications, challenges and potential, with a critical view over the maturity of these projects. Our findings indicate that blockchain is a promising technology towards a transparent supply chain of food, with many ongoing initiatives in various food products and food-related issues, but many barriers and challenges still exist, which hinder its wider popularity among farmers and systems. These challenges involve technical aspects, education, policies and regulatory frameworks."
,,,"In this concept paper, we will address several critical questions: how can we enhance smart use of precious resources, support environmental sustainability and assist the developing world in their growth process? We put forward a policy framework that can potentially address these three questions and in addition could represent a critical step towards a circular economy eliminating the need for a post-resource discussion. Using precious metals as an example, we present a novel concept that combines policy, business and technological aspects aimed at making efficient use of finite resources and distributing the revenue more evenly. This approach could hence create jobs and eliminate the need of a post-resource discussion for post-industrial economies. Moreover, we will illustrate herein how this approach could be the initial step of the leapfrogging to a post-resource economy with maximized employment. Furthermore, the advance of some emerging technologies, such as block chain and associated smart contracts could be leveraged to track the primary asset being leased. We also note the broader impact on sustainability and economics with the implications of such a model in driving a circular economy, encouraging GDP growth, addressing resource â€œscarcityâ€ and on the environment."
,,,"There is no doubt that the world will need more food in the future, as demand is driven by a growing population and rising incomes. However, this increase in food demand will be constrained by scarcer resources, more attention to food security, and changing dietary habits. Today, the most effective way to increase the amount of food produced is through efficiency gains, as clearing new land for agricultural activities stopped being sustainable a long time ago. The obvious and most effective way to gain efficiencies is to reduce the amount of food that is produced but not consumed. Food losses may happen before or after the retail point, and these are distinguished by calling the former food loss and the latter food waste. Although the problems related to food waste are just as severe as those related to food loss and there have been considerable efforts to reduce food waste, the success of these initiatives relies to a great extent on public awareness and policies aimed at changing consumer behavior. By contrast, avoiding food loss is more amenable to the use of quantitative techniques and digital technology, and for this reason, the discussion in this chapter will be mostly focused on food loss, although our review provides pointers to causes and current progress in food waste prevention. In this chapter, we review the potential impact of some new digital technologies, including quantitative logistic optimization models, to avoid food loss: we explain the importance of having good quality data, discuss methodologies to obtain and validate the data, and briefly review new technologies like the Internet of Things to obtain data updates in real time. After the review, we present a case study of a vegetable supply chain to illustrate the usefulness of the approach, and end with a summary of new technologies to reduce food loss."
,,,"Smart cities functions have been represented in the form of a metaphorical mandala co-opted to serve as an abstract simplification for the public to understand the complexities of smart cities, as well as to compartmentalize the principal functions as discrete facets of the operating system architecture. These six smart functions - Mobility, Environment, People, Governance, Economy and Living - serve their own purpose within the urban framework while simultaneously supporting the collective operations of the city, and over time will develop new typologies and sub-functions as dynamic, transforming systems. In order to explore these functions as part of the evolutionary development of cities, the Multi-Level Perspective model (MLP) has been applied to map diverse urban scenarios as they transition in terms of past (Evolution), present (Challenges) and future (Directions). Since each city's progression is determined by its unique city DNA profile, each smart city function is modeled by describing and visualizing this progression. In parallel, to support the theory and application of convergence, the inter-relationship of human, technological and natural systems is explored along the dimensions of Object, Action and Outcome to articulate the key variables that influence the trajectory of each smart city's distinct technological evolution and transformation."
,,,"Major changes in the job market are currently observed, among others a consequence of the introduction of information and communication technology (ICT) in port areas. The question is how important the mismatch is between supply and demand for jobs, skills and competences, as a consequence among others of the above-mentioned changes. From literature, general trends in the job market are identified and their impact is translated to new trends in ports. The aim of the research is threefold: mapping the eventual mismatch in terms of employment, examining whether technological innovations (ICT and automation) have an impact on the future professions and specialisations and identifying the skills that need to be developed by education. The case is the maritime and non-maritime cluster in the port of Antwerp looking forward at a 2030 horizon. Next to conducting a literature review, the study analyses quantitative data on the characteristics of employment in the port of Antwerp provided by the social security administration. Moreover a qualitative analysis through interviews was done in close cooperation with the port community, including port companies, port associations and educational institutes. The main results are threefold. First, the appearance of a polarised job market, where due to ICT introduction and automation, a lot of middle-paid paperwork jobs disappear. Second, that jobs on the floor will be more and more assisted by robotics and data applications and analysis, including use of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Third, that management jobs will become more and more complex with multi-skilling becoming a key. Therefore training programmes must include new skills like ICT, but also soft skills like teamwork and communication. Special attention is needed to motivate and host females and non-natives in the port job market."
,,,"Records of human civilization portray a history of the rise and fall of urban settlements, which have functioned as the nuclei of human activities in all ancient and modern civilizations. Cities are where the fabric of human destiny is woven and where scientific innovations and technological achievements are predominantly reflected. The main focus of todayâ€™s urban managers is to cope with the tremendous changes occurring as a result of the megatrend of urbanization. As such, this article provides a contextual discourse on the subject of contemporary urbanization. It looks at historical circumstances, the nature of city problems and challenges that have arisen, the initiatives that are being taken to counteract manifest difficulties including application of the concept of urban sustainability, and the value of robust measurement of the effectiveness of city sustainability initiatives."
,,,"Billions of people currently lack clean water and sanitation. By 2050 the global population will have grown to nearly 10 billion, over two-thirds of whom will live in urban areas. This Voices asks: what are the research and water-management priorities to ensure clean water and sanitation in the worldâ€™s cities?"
,,,"This review advances the discussion about the future of laboratory medicine in the 2020s. In five major topic areas: 1. the â€œbig pictureâ€ of healthcare; 2. pre-analytical factors; 3. Analytical factors; 4. post-analytical factors; and 5. relationships, which explores a next decade perspective on laboratory medicine and the likely impact of the predicted changes by means of a number of carefully focused questions that draw upon predictions made since 2013. The â€œbig pictureâ€ of healthcare explores the effects of changing patient populations, the brain-to-brain loop, direct access testing, robots and total laboratory automation, and green technologies and sustainability. The pre-analytical section considers the role of different sample types, drones, and biobanks. The analytical section examines advances in point-of-care testing, mass spectrometry, genomics, gene and immunotherapy, 3D-printing, and total laboratory quality. The post-analytical section discusses the value of laboratory medicine, the emerging role of artificial intelligence, the management and interpretation of omics data, and common reference intervals and decision limits. Finally, the relationships section explores the role of laboratory medicine scientific societies, the educational needs of laboratory professionals, communication, the relationship between laboratory professionals and clinicians, laboratory medicine financing, and the anticipated economic opportunities and outcomes in the 2020's."
,,,"IBM is an iconic corporation, whose history of innovation and growth has been told many times in many ways. In this short retelling, the focus is from the perspective of service and service growth. In the early 1990s, during what was arguably IBM's darkest days, it was a return to service and service growth that saved IBM and dramatically grew the IT services industry. This paper shares some personal reflections on the history of IBM from a service perspective, and advocates for more service research to advance our understanding of service systems and service growth."
,,,"Telehealth is defined as the use of information and communication technology for persons and communities who have difficulty in accessing their healthcare provider. It is the future of healthcare, enabling quality healthcare for all without the constraints of time and distance. This introductory chapter lays the foundation for the rest of the book, which, in turn, is an attempt to promote adoption of telehealth by providing its basis and how to make it a reality."
,,,"This article advances a proposal for conservation basic income (CBI) as a novel strategy for funding biodiversity conservation that moves beyond widely promoted market-based instruments (MBIs). This CBI proposal responds to two important empirical developments. The first concerns growing discussions around cash transfer programs (CTPs) and universal basic income (UBI). These are increasingly implemented or piloted yet do not usually take into account environmental issues including biodiversity conservation. The second relates to MBIs like payments for ecosystem services (PES) and REDD+ (reduced emissions through avoided deforestation and forest degradation). In practice, these programs have not only commonly failed to halt biodiversity loss and alleviate poverty but have also largely abandoned their market-based origins, leading to calls for moving beyond market-based conservation entirely. We conclude that the time is right to integrate and transcend these existing mechanisms to develop conservation basic income as part of a broader paradigm shift towards convivial conservation that foregrounds concerns for social justice and equity."
,,,"This chapter describes the drivers for the Internet of Things (IoT) from a business perspective. As a result of open, web-based technologies, IoT solutions will drive the creation of Information Marketplaces that allow the exchange of data between different economic entities within an information value chain. In order to capture the economic benefits of these IoT installations, however, companies need to understand how to build effective business models within the emerging industrial structure. This chapter explains Information Marketplaces and provides examples of business model innovation in order to illustrate how companies may take advantage of the emerging industry."
,,,"Digital technologies are transforming the delivery of financial services everywhere. Among its many benefits, â€œfintechâ€ offers new opportunities to widen access to financial services. The potential for improving people's lives through financial inclusion is enormous, and many of the gains are already being realized. There are risks as well, though, and making the most of these opportunities will require skillful regulation. At the moment, regulators and policymakers alike are struggling to keep up."
,,,"We address the rise of the knowledge society, reviewing the major contributors to its conceptualization from Karl Marx onward. Synthesizing their ideas, we characterize the current state and direction of the knowledge society, its connection to related ideas of digital economy, e-government, and others, and detail implications for business and other organizations, and for society at large."
,,,"To keep the planet on the 2Â°C trajectory, developing countries alone will require US$500 billion annually by 2030 to adequately mitigate their carbon emissions, in addition to several hundred billion additional dollars for adaptation needs. The US$100 billion a year pledged by developed countries through the Green Climate Fund is such insufficient that most of the climate finance required will have to come from the private sector. As a scene-setting chapter, it will delineate the scale of climate investment required, the state of climate finance post-Paris Agreement, climate mitigation and adaptation investment trends, global climate finance landscape, specific hurdles against climate investment, and the problems with climate finance tracking and monitoring. The lack of trust and transparency in the global climate finance landscape provides an excellent ground on which to deploy Blockchain technology to turbo-boost global climate finance flows. This chapter will initiate the discussion on how Blockchain as a â€œtrust machineâ€ could address the many deeply-rooted institutional problems."
,,,"If the world were 100 people, 1 person would hold over 50% of all assets. This simple example demonstrates the level of financial exclusion in our world; the chasm between the ones that have and the ones that have little to nothing. Overcoming this problem has been the topic of many books, reports, research papers, political speeches, NGO efforts and even laws. Yet the current state of the world shows how little progress we have made. In this chapter, I will outline how new technologies and a deeper understanding of our own individual and societal psychological development together put the tools into our hands to create an equitable world through decentralized, automated trust."
,,,"The carbon deposit is an innovative form of carbon finance that leverages the power of soils to absorb most of the worldâ€™s anthropogenic carbon emissions. In the carbon-deposit system, farmers are paid to practice regenerative agriculture that sequesters carbon in healthy soil using the funds raised from a carbon tax. Blockchains are used to provide the accounting for the system by tracking each ton of carbon from its emissions source to its soil sink. The carbon-deposit system combines an American carbon tax proposal with the French Ministry of Agricultureâ€™s â€œ4 per 1000â€ project to promote soil health as an overlooked climate change solution."
,,,"The contributors to this volume envisage how the transformation of the electric power industry is likely to evolve and what might be the impact of distributed energy resources on the incumbents and new entrants. This chapter acknowledges that while a myriad of new products and services are likely to emerge appealing to a growing number of prosumers, the bulk of customers are likely to remain solely or mostly dependent on the existing grid and reasonably content with bundled services at regulated tariffs. The resulting bifurcation of consumers and prosumers will be among the most vexing challenges facing regulators who must ultimately find ways to keep both constituents content without stifling innovation."
,,,"Policy initiatives towards reduction of CO2 emissions implemented so far are grounded on the so-called Production-Based paradigm: this approach allocates responsibility of emissions to countries that directly caused such emissions, without taking into account all the indirect contributions to CO2 emissions caused outside countryâ€™s borders, eventually leading to the so-called carbon leakage phenomenon. In this paper, the alternative Consumption-Based approach is proposed, and its effectiveness assessed: according to this approach, policy initiatives allocates responsibility for CO2 emissions proportionally to the CO2 emissions embedded in goods and services required by industries as inputs for production. Global environmental and economic consequences of carbon emissions reduction policies, applied at the European level based on both Production- and Consumption-Based paradigms, are comparatively assessed based on the World Trade Model with Bilateral Trades. Results of this study suggest that defining CO2 emissions policies based on a Consumption-Based paradigm seems to be the most effective way to reduce the global carbon emissions, avoiding the carbon leakage phenomenon which may occur in economies regulated by Production-Based policies. Indeed, an imposed reduction in CO2 emissions embedded in EU final demand through a Consumption-Based Accounting policy would result in a global CO2 emissions reduction up to almost 1.2 Gton. On the other hand, an imposed reduction in direct EU CO2 emissions according to a PBA approach would result in an overall increase in global carbon emissions up to almost 0.8 Gton."
,,,"The setting up of the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU) at Sussex University 50 years ago represented a â€œtransformative changeâ€ in the research on science policy and the understanding of the nature and origin of technological change and innovation studies. It influenced policymakers across the world in both the mature Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries and the developing world. It made the topic of science, technology and innovation (STI) familiar to business studies scholars. Today though, the analysis of STI appears to be somewhat in crisis. On the one hand, there is growing evidence that the growth and welfare gains of new technologies and innovation are no longer forthcoming in an automatic â€œtrickle-downâ€ fashion. The knowledge and technology diffusion â€œmachineâ€ appears broken. On the other hand, there are growing environmental concerns about the negative externalities of unsustainable fossil-fuel-based growth as industrialization spreads across the globe. STI policy appears somehow stuck in an industrial efficiency and consumerism mode that is unable to address in a satisfactory way the impact of such negative externalities. Can the broader historical approach as popularized within the so-called Science and Technology Studies (STS) tradition provide additional, complementary insights? Yes, if STI and STS scholars are prepared to leave their respective conceptual comfort zones and address in complementary fashion some of the major societal policy challenges confronting science, technology and innovation policy today."
,,,"Fully decarbonizing global industry is essential to achieving climate stabilization, and reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050â€“2070 is necessary to limit global warming to 2Â Â°C. This paper assembles and evaluates technical and policy interventions, both on the supply side and on the demand side. It identifies measures that, employed together, can achieve net zero industrial emissions in the required timeframe. Key supply-side technologies include energy efficiency (especially at the system level), carbon capture, electrification, and zero-carbon hydrogen as a heat source and chemical feedstock. There are also promising technologies specific to each of the three top-emitting industries: cement, iron & steel, and chemicals & plastics. These include cement admixtures and alternative chemistries, several technological routes for zero-carbon steelmaking, and novel chemical catalysts and separation technologies. Crucial demand-side approaches include material-efficient design, reductions in material waste, substituting low-carbon for high-carbon materials, and circular economy interventions (such as improving product longevity, reusability, ease of refurbishment, and recyclability). Strategic, well-designed policy can accelerate innovation and provide incentives for technology deployment. High-value policies include carbon pricing with border adjustments or other price signals; robust government support for research, development, and deployment; and energy efficiency or emissions standards. These core policies should be supported by labeling and government procurement of low-carbon products, data collection and disclosure requirements, and recycling incentives. In implementing these policies, care must be taken to ensure a just transition for displaced workers and affected communities. Similarly, decarbonization must complement the human and economic development of low- and middle-income countries."
,,,"The ever-increasing worldwide demand for automation has augmented the adoption of technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning for industrial developments. Among the recent technological advancements, intelligent robots are increasingly becoming an integral part of several firms. The study focuses on the impact of intelligent robots on productivity, competitiveness and how firms are leveraging automation. This study uses centering resonance analysis (CRA) to develop an empirically grounded understanding of the rationale for robotization, through secondary archived data. Through the content analysis of over 261 online published articles, we decipher the derived themes through the following theoretical frameworks: behavioral, economic, and operations management perspectives. The findings suggest that firms are leveraging the concept of robotization to increase performance, efficiency, and profit. The deployment of robots in various firm domains focuses on public welfare, consumer orientation, and a sustainable environment and agriculture."
,,,"Blockchain technologies have captured the imagination of scholars, managers, and practitioners around the world. It is widely accepted by these actors that blockchain is not a buzzword, but a highly disruptive technology that is already remodeling the organizations and their supply chain business models. Despite the meaningful advance in the last years, blockchain applications regarding the operations and supply chain management (OSCM) are still in their infancy. Little is known about the role of blockchain in terms of operations traceability, as well in areas such as e-commerce, agriculture, public services, etc. Therefore, this Special Issue seeks to extend our understanding of blockchain applications in OSCM and how firms create and capture business value with blockchain. To this effect, this Special Issue will provide a well-articulated and in-depth discussion of the role of blockchain in creating value in the domain of OSCM. Specifically, it is expected that more light is shed on how blockchain integrates with and impacts new business models, transforms relationships, and improves performance and competitive advantage in OSCM. Also, the evolution of blockchain was reviewed in order to provide a strong background to the readers. The literature review was performed taking into account a bibliometric perspective of blockchain-related publications. The review supports the importance of this Special Issue by highlighting the urgent needs of this topic in this reputable journal. Finally, we provide future research directions and a guide for the papers presented in this Special Issue."
,,,"The energy poverty cycle continues to pose a major challenge for governments in emerging economies. Electrification has typically been delivered through centralised generation and distribution that has not always afforded equitable or efficient access. Decentralised solar technologies are fast approaching financial parity and have certain environmental advantages over grid extension, especially in rural and remote societies. We explore the emergence of decentralised energy systems in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India's most populated state with notable energy access and equity challenges. We suggest future electrification policies and strategies should be based on the principles of diversity in technology use, localised implementation and centralised planning and enforcement to address energy poverty conundrum in the state of Uttar Pradesh or similar economies."
,,,"Agriculture 4.0 is comprised of different already operational or developing technologies such as robotics, nanotechnology, synthetic protein, cellular agriculture, gene editing technology, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and machine learning, which may have pervasive effects on future agriculture and food systems and major transformative potential. These technologies underpin conÂ­ceptsÂ suchÂ asÂ verÂ­tiÂ­calÂ farmÂ­ing and food systems,Â digÂ­iÂ­talÂ agriÂ­culÂ­ture,Â bioeÂ­conÂ­omy,Â cirÂ­cuÂ­larÂ agriÂ­culÂ­ture,Â andÂ aquaponÂ­ics. In this perspective paper, we argue that more attention is needed for the inclusion and exclusion effects of Agriculture 4.0 technologies, and for reflection on how they relate to diverse transition pathways towards sustainable agricultural and food systems driven by mission-oriented innovation systems. This would require processes of responsible innovation, anticipating the potential impacts of Agriculture 4.0 through inclusive processes, and reflecting on and being responsive to emerging effects and where needed adjusting the direction and course of transition pathways."
,,,"This chapter looks at the risks associated with financial activity in the digital and online space by corporations including digital payment systems, digital and cryptocurrency (Bitcoin and others), crowdfunding, online microfinancing, online investments, etc. The second part of this chapter focuses on one specific purpose of corporate spending through advocacy and digital campaigns (e.g., lobbying, charitable fundraising)."
,,,"With the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), the growing use of autonomous sensing and actuating devices in areas such as smart grid, e-healthcare, home networking, and machine-to-machine (M2M) communication has become an important communication paradigm. Nonetheless, to fully exploit the applications facilitated by M2M communication, service requirements such as data throughput, scalability and reliability must be in place. This paper proposes a new backoff adaptation mechanism known as probability-based opportunity dynamic adaptation (PODA) for M2M communication using the IEEE 802.11ah protocol. The proposed PODA is an enhanced version of the binary exponential backoff (BEB) where a station estimates the number of contending stations in a distributed manner and adaptively tunes its minimum contention window (CW) prior to the contention process for better network throughput and packet delivery ratio. Owing to its great flexibility and ease of implementation, BEB has been extended to home M2M communication such as wireless sensor networks and smart grid technologies without relying on wide area communication. However, the current form of BEB has its shortcomings in the emerging M2M paradigm. The adaptation of CW in PODA is based on the optimal station's access opportunity to improve network performance instead of direct CW scaling. Using the proposed adaptation method, the network throughput can be improved by as much as 18 percent in the home M2M network studied, while enhancing network reliability and fairness."
,,,"Polyglot persistence facilitates use of most suitable database technology based on the requirement of an application. There are lots of use cases as well as huge potential for Polyglot Persistence in e-Commerce web portals, Search Engines, and Healthcare Information Ecosystem applications. But, designing and implementation of an application in a Polyglot environment is not a straightforward task, since adding more data storage technologies increases complexity in programming. Further knowledge of multiple programming languages, maintainability of the Polyglot application, and tool support for Polyglot persistence are the challenges of Polyglot Persistence. This chapter discusses the various aspects of Polyglot persistence with a focus on NoSQL database."
,,,"The gate to the services behind-the-meter lies at the meter stage. Smart meters provide real-time consumption data that can be used by other smart devices, appliances, and applications to improve the efficiency of energy use. This chapter examines the role that smart meters can play in promoting the consumer/prosumer/prosumager engagement and asset aggregation behind the meter. A sound design of smart-meter rollout and a proactive use of the data made available henceforth may either promote or hinder the development of services behind the meter. As the consumer becomes engaged and possibly evolves in prosumer or prosumager, a legally valid, close to the real-time reading of energy flows to and from the meter is required."
,,,"Blockchain is a relatively new technology originally created to store Bitcoinâ€™s transaction records. The system is highly redundant and distributed, making it very difficult for fraudulent financial transactions. While cryptocurrencies might be the most well-known use case of blockchain technology, it is wrong to assume that this technology is restricted to the financial area. Indeed, many blockchain use cases are being developed today in different areas. Due to the complexity of certain processes, a new technology associated to blockchain has appeared â€“ smart contracts. These digital contracts act like traditional contracts, with the major difference being their automaticity. In this article, we aim to discuss how blockchain and smart contracts may be used together in order to improve organizational operations. More specifically, we demonstrate how these technologies might be used to develop a solution that avoids certain types of fraud in the area of vehicle insurance."
,,,"Quite interesting developments are occurring on the African financial landscape. The growth of mobile payments services; agent banking; the increase in the use of crowdfunding mechanisms to raise finance; and the growing interest in the use of cryptocurrencies by Africans to transact have all contributed to this trend. A common factor running through these recent developments is their ability to facilitate financial inclusion. Another characteristic they all share is that they all have cross-border dimensions. This therefore requires a coordinated approach to regulation, of which a regional regulatory approach is likely to play a prominent role. The increasing speed of these developments in this era of financial technology calls for the urgent institution of a robust regional financial regulatory framework that addresses key issues raised by them and which this chapter considers."
,,,"Blockchains or distributed ledgers are an emerging technology that has drawn considerable interest from energy supply firms, startups, technology developers, financial institutions, national governments and the academic community. Numerous sources coming from these backgrounds identify blockchains as having the potential to bring significant benefits and innovation. Blockchains promise transparent, tamper-proof and secure systems that can enable novel business solutions, especially when combined with smart contracts. This work provides a comprehensive overview of fundamental principles that underpin blockchain technologies, such as system architectures and distributed consensus algorithms. Next, we focus on blockchain solutions for the energy industry and inform the state-of-the-art by thoroughly reviewing the literature and current business cases. To our knowledge, this is one of the first academic, peer-reviewed works to provide a systematic review of blockchain activities and initiatives in the energy sector. Our study reviews 140 blockchain research projects and startups from which we construct a map of the potential and relevance of blockchains for energy applications. These initiatives were systematically classified into different groups according to the field of activity, implementation platform and consensus strategy used.11A summary of the research projects reviewed in this study can be found in the Appendix A. Opportunities, potential challenges and limitations for a number of use cases are discussed, ranging from emerging peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading and Internet of Things (IoT) applications, to decentralised marketplaces, electric vehicle charging and e-mobility. For each of these use cases, our contribution is twofold: first, in identifying the technical challenges that blockchain technology can solve for that application as well as its potential drawbacks, and second in briefly presenting the research and industrial projects and startups that are currently applying blockchain technology to that area. The paper ends with a discussion of challenges and market barriers the technology needs to overcome to get past the hype phase, prove its commercial viability and finally be adopted in the mainstream."
,,,"There is a steady global trend towards â€œData Localization,â€ laws by which data is required to be maintained and processed within the geographic boundaries of its state of origin. This development has raised concerns about its possible adverse impacts on emerging data-intensive technologies such as Cloud services/E-commerce, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things (collectively, the Embedded Infosphere). The inability to reach an international agreement on rules for cross-border data flows may have significant adverse consequences for all future users of the Internet. The basis of Data Localization is grounded in two distinct but inter-related policy models: Data Sovereignty and Trans-Border Data Flows. These two concepts have different origins. â€œData Sovereigntyâ€ is derived from the historic power of a state of absolute and exclusive control within its geographic borders. Policies behind TBDFs arose in Europe following World War II, primarily motivated by Nazi use of early proto-computers to help round up Jews and others. As they have evolved, TBDF policies have been directed primarily at protecting personal data and privacy. This article first examines the issues of: 1) â€œInformation Sovereigntyâ€ and 2) TBDFs. It then describes the arguments for and against â€œData Localization,â€ offers some examples of strong localization policies (Russia, China), and summarizes contesting policy proposals. It then contextualizes TBDF with issues of human rights (free flow of information) and privacy. While the utility of an international agreement on TBDFs is clear, the differences in approaches are tenacious. For the free-market developed world (e.g, EU, OECD), the path forward seems to lead through policy convergence to compatible rules, with differentiated levels of data protection and accountability. It is far from clear whether these rules will address, in a mandatory way, issues of the â€œfree flowâ€ of information in the human rights sense. At the same time, there are countries (e.g., BRICS), representing a majority of the world's population, in which political and cultural resistance will produce stringent Cyber Sovereignty and Data Localization policies with few if any human rights components. The article concludes that the more the Internet is â€œlocalizedâ€, the more attenuated its benefits will become. The negative consequences of Data Localization will become increasingly obvious as new, data-intensive technologies become ubiquitous, creating a condition of â€œData Dependenceâ€. It is projected that in the future the nations with the least amount of Data Localization and the most open flow of information will be the most successful in benefiting from new data-intensive embedded, networked technologies. This will most likely be characterized by values adopted as policies and practices in the EU."
,,,"Novel technologies are continually being developed every day. Lessons from the past show that some resulted in unintended harm to the Earthâ€™s system. The challenge for organizations working at the interface of the environment, technology, and society is, therefore, how to best harness the environmental benefits from new technologies while minimizing their potential adverse effects. Here, we identify some of the emerging technologies that the international development community needs to consider as it seeks to take advantage of new technologies to promote sustainable development. There are several innovations â€“ such as blockchain, nanotechnology, synthetic biology, cellular agriculture, and gene editing techniques that could either positively or negatively affect the environment, food security, human health, and the transition to clean energy. Some of their benefits and potential environmental and socio-economic concerns are discussed. We further suggest actions that can be taken by organizations involved in sustainable development, such as the United Nations and other global and regional bodies, to exploit the benefits from novel technologies and mitigate their risks."
,,,"This paper explores the evolving renewable energy â€˜prosumerâ€™ phenomenon in the United Kingdom (UK). It identifies and evaluates how prosumer business models can exist beyond direct subsidy and the range of prosumer business model archetypes currently in operation. Through a series of in-depth interviews and document analysis, the paper identifies the key opportunities and challenges for these innovative energy business models. The analysis shows that recent developments in technology such as the diffusion of smart meters, li-ion batteries, peer-to-peer trading platforms and electric vehicles are opening up a range of new value propositions, which in turn are beginning to be exploited by a range of new business models. In many cases the regulatory, financing and institutional governance landscape of the UK lags behind, however, inhibiting these emerging business models. Moreover, these business models rely on managing a complex set of values for consumers that reach deeper into their lives than traditional tariffs. Thus, successful business models must manage this complexity if they are to be adopted by the disengaged majority. Energy policy and energy practitioners can leverage these emerging trends in service of a low carbon energy transition by adopting â€˜ten principlesâ€™ of prosumerism; and six UK policy recommendations."
,,,"Global attention focuses primarily on the benefits that new digital technologies can offer people across the world, especially on their contribution to economic growth. It has become increasingly evident, however, that these technologies have also been associated with a dramatic increase in inequalities at every scale. While the rich and powerful can benefit from the latest technologies, the poorest and most marginalized, without access or the ability to use them, are left further behind. Those with disabilities, women and girls, street children, refugees, and those living in isolated areas can indeed all be empowered through such technologies, but only if explicit focus is placed on this agenda. Researchers have identified seven things necessary to turn back the tide of digital inequality: a refocusing of attention by governments, the private sector, and civil society on the poorest and most marginalized; technological innovation in the interests of, and with, the poorest; a rebalancing of power in the interests of elected governments rather than the private sector so that citizens can be more empowered; enhanced understanding of the role of effective partnerships; greater awareness of the dark side of digital technologies and security issues; greater systemic understanding and ethical interpretation across society of the potential uses of digital technologies; and realization that building the technologies is actually the easy part."
,,,"This chapter profoundly contextualises the emerging interplay between the process of diffusion of ICTs and, broadly defined, shifts in national welfare. It examines various aspects of the relationship of ICTs with social and economic development: why ICTs are treated as opportunity windows, why they are a prerequisite for socio-economic development, and how they can affect the performance of financial markets. It briefly discusses the channels through which growing access to and use of new ICTs can affect social, financial, and economic development of countries, and thus generate overall wealth."
,,,"Sustainability expresses culturally evolving sets of values, norms, morals, civic engagements, governance, markets, and corporate ethics. Sustainable initiatives emerge as necessary adaptations to ceaseless human activities transforming Earth's energy, matter and information into entropy, externalities, and inequalities. The uncertainty and unknown unknowns intrinsic to life's nonlinear dynamic complexities make sustainability forever provisional, and given planetary scale disruptions humans are triggering, sustainability in the Anthropocene should seek the greatest resilience at city scale. Disruptions impact localities more frequently than nations and it is largely up to local citizens to implement antifragile sustainable practices minimizing such occurrences and enabling robust recoveries."
,,,"New financial applications called â€œFintechâ€ are disrupting traditional financial services. The scope and importance of Fintech is not fully appreciated or taught in traditional Financial Markets courses. On the other end of the spectrum, popular coverage of Fintech tends to be overly promotional and understates the response of the big banks to protect their franchises. This book presents an overview of traditional financial products and services and the Fintech disruptors in each area. Regulation of financial markets is also covered along with a review of Fintechâ€™s negative contribution to some important social issues. Finally, there is a review of the Fintech activities of the big banks."
,,,"Expectedly, different countries and sometimes different states within a country have different laws. The laws and related ethics governing telemedicine and telehealth are concerned with the ideal methods of care delivery but get complicated due to crossing of geographical boundaries. Safety and security are additional problems enabled by easy access to care and related health information. There is a possibility of misuse by the ones who may be more technically savvy even while not being qualified to deliver care."
,,,"As far back as the industrial revolution, significant development in technical innovation has succeeded in transforming numerous manual tasks and processes that had been in existence for decades where humans had reached the limits of physical capacity. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers this same transformative potential for the augmentation and potential replacement of human tasks and activities within a wide range of industrial, intellectual and social applications. The pace of change for this new AI technological age is staggering, with new breakthroughs in algorithmic machine learning and autonomous decision-making, engendering new opportunities for continued innovation. The impact of AI could be significant, with industries ranging from: finance, healthcare, manufacturing, retail, supply chain, logistics and utilities, all potentially disrupted by the onset of AI technologies. The study brings together the collective insight from a number of leading expert contributors to highlight the significant opportunities, realistic assessment of impact, challenges and potential research agenda posed by the rapid emergence of AI within a number of domains: business and management, government, public sector, and science and technology. This research offers significant and timely insight to AI technology and its impact on the future of industry and society in general, whilst recognising the societal and industrial influence on pace and direction of AI development."
,,,"Transformation of agribusiness is critical in light of the Agenda for Sustainable Development. FinTech and the integration of FinTech with other (green) technologies as well as with digitized agriculture plays an important role when it comes to, for example, SDG 12, specifically, responsible production, as it can mitigate trade-offs and enhance synergies between environmental and social SDGs, for example, 1 and 15, increasing profitability without additional use of natural resources. Important limitations and risks need to be addressed, however, for developing countries to fully benefit from the potential that FinTech holds in this context. Mitigating factors include massive infrastructure investments and large-scale capacity building. Rigorous research on economic sustainability and cost-effectiveness of newer FinTech models is needed to make sound policy recommendations."
,,,"This chapter examines how FinTech is breaking barriers to financial inclusion. It first traces the history of FinTech and its evolution both globally and in Africa. Then it reviews the impact of selected FinTech products in African countries. Several observations are noteworthy. First, mobile money facilitated by mobile technology stands out as the most successful innovation in extending financial inclusion in Africa. Second, the most promising innovation that has the potential to alleviate SME funding constraints is crowdfunding. However, this potential can only be realized by increasing internet access in Africa, the region with the lowest penetration. Finally, the chapter discusses the challenges facing the proliferation of FinTech investments in Africa."
,,,"In light of the concerted efforts to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) per the so-called Paris Agreement, the Information and Communication Industry (ICT) has received little attention as a significant contributor to GHGE and if anything is often highly praised for enabling efficiencies that help reduce other industry sectors footprint. In this paper, we aim at assessing the global carbon footprint of the overall ICT industry, including the contribution from the main consumer devices, the data centers and communication networks, and compare it with the to the total worldwide GHGE. We conduct a detailed and rigorous analysis of the ICT global carbon footprint, including both the production and the operational energy of ICT devices, as well as the operational energy for the supporting ICT infrastructure. We then compare this contribution to the global 2016-level GHGE. We have found that, if unchecked, ICT GHGE relative contribution could grow from roughly 1â€“1.6% in 2007 to exceed 14% of the 2016-level worldwide GHGE by 2040, accounting for more than half of the current relative contribution of the whole transportation sector. Our study also highlights the contribution of smart phones and shows that by 2020, the footprint of smart phones alone would surpass the individual contribution of desktops, laptops and displays. Finally, we offer some actionable recommendations on how to mitigate and curb the ICT explosive GHGE footprint, through a combination of renewable energy use, tax policies, managerial actions and alternative business models."
,,,"The chapter explores the landscape of microfinance institutions and the informal finance sector in Africa as well as the regulatory environment. It also discusses the phenomenon of microinsurance, which though nascent in Africa is on the rise. Mobile money is also discussed as one component of microfinance, which is growing by leaps and bounds throughout Africa, having first taken root in East Africa. Lastly, the chapter peers into the future of microfinance institutions in light of technological developments."
,,,"Much of the attention surrounding blockchain today is focused on financial services, with very little discussion about nonfinancial services firms and how blockchain technology may affect organizations, their business models, and how they create and deliver value. In addition, some confusion remains between the blockchain (with definite article) and blockchain (no article), distributed ledger technologies, and their applications. Our article offers a primer on blockchain technology aimed at general managers and executives. The key contributions of this article lie in providing an explanation of blockchain, including how a blockchain transaction works and a clarification of terms, and outlining different types of blockchain technologies. We also discuss how different types of blockchain impact business models. Building on the well-established business model framework by Osterwalder and Pigneur, we outline the effect that blockchain technologies can have on each element of the business model, along with illustrations from firms developing blockchain technology."
,,,"The emergence of artificial general intelligence and the global brain provides new opportunities for realizing humanity's long quest for a more utopian existence. One possibility is a more successful implementation of the state socialist vision of a centrally managed economy, possibly controlled by an AGI â€œNannyâ€ instead of a central committee of politicians. An alternative outcome, more in keeping with the original Marxist vision of the withering away of the state, may be the mutualist vision of organizing economic and social life along voluntary lines. A number of recent developments and new ideas may facilitate this outcome. The institution of the commons, in the past available only to small geographical communities, can now be used by global communities. Open collaboration and exchange networks facilitate voluntary cooperative activity by people at dispersed physical locations. Open Production Networks can make the most complicated economic exchanges transparent to consumers, allowing them to factor ethical and sociological considerations into their purchasing decisions. Offer Networks can help people with similar interests and complementary abilities to organize joint projects and organizations. Blockchain technologies could be used to create transparent currencies in which transactions can be done openly. These and other related technologies have the potential to humanize global economic interactions, giving them more emotional resonance, as increasing affluence lessens individual and societal preoccupation with maximizing economic gain."
,,,"There is a metabolic rift running through our economy and culture, and it is distracting our attention from care for the biosphere. To heal this rift, the diverse groups of people that make up humankind need a shared purpose that everyone can relate to and support. A strong candidate for that shared purpose is care for the bioregionâ€”bioregioningâ€”as an activity that creates value. In this article, I present a number of design actions and case studies that demonstrate how design can contribute to system change, for example via the reconnection of urban and rural ecosystems, the design of social infrastructures that enable the emergence of new enterprises, and the deployment of technology."
,,,"Technological development is a longstanding matter of concern in the comprehension of economic growth and wealth. However, a deeper understanding regarding the process of technological catching-up and development of emerging economies is yet to be further gathered. Thus, the aim of this article is to comprehend the path for developing frontier indigenous technologies through technology and knowledge transfer (TKT) and public-private partnerships (PPP). Based on a case-study of technological development in the field of molecular diagnostics in southern Brazil, this article provides a three-stage conical-helix model of technological catching up and development through TKT and PPPs. In the start-up stage, public research actors generate technological capabilities via TKT processes at the local level; in the catching-up stage, frontier technologies are gathered through a new TKT from international actors; in the rising-up stage, frontier technology is developed indigenously and transferred to national and international private industries through PPPs. Therefore, the conical-helix model presented in this study may potentially contribute to the development and implementation of a new generation of public policies for technological development in emerging economies, reducing technological dependence on imported technologies from developed nations."
,,,"Our paper contributes to the nascent field of technological entrepreneurial intent by proposing a model linking studentsâ€™ entrepreneurial intent to digitalization of the economy, and providing evidence based on a small transition economy: Kosovo. Our sample is composed of 310 students from two universities in Kosovo (University of Pristina and University of Applied Sciences in Ferizaj). These two universities account for around 60% of student enrolment in Kosovo. We use a modified version of the Entrepreneurial Intention Questionnaire (EIQ) scale developed by LiÃ±Ã¡n and Chen (2009) which considers the extent of digitalization of the economy. The findings reveal that personal attitude and behavioral content are the main determinants of entrepreneurial intention; our structural model shows that they explain 72.7% of the total variance."
,,,"This chapter discusses the technical considerations for implementing food safety and quality systems in developing countries considering current and future requirements. It will build on initial discussions in Volumes I and II and present more details on requirements for exporting food products into Europe, the United States of America, Canada and Australasia. It will examine the state of food safety within selected countries in the Far East, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Africa and considerations for exporting from these markets into others. Among the issues to be examined are national food laws, regulatory frameworks, compliance and enforcement, national and regional regulatory cooperation and the role of national and regional regulators in facilitating access to export markets and regional trade alliances. The interaction of trade with food safety, nutrition and food security is explored. The chapter provides overviews of the EU and Australia/New Zealand regulatory environment and focused, detailed overviews of key components of the US FDAâ€™s Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) 2011 and the Safe Foods for Canadians Act 2012. Included are explanations of critical components of FSMA and the SFCA, their implications, as well as possible approaches to compliance for food industry and market access practitioners."
,,,"The disruptive innovation theory, proposed and developed by Christensen over 20 years ago, has been widely discussed and applied. However, there are still serious misunderstanding and misusing of the concept and connotation of disruptive innovation. Doubts about its practical significance and predictability also remain. In this paper, we attempt to further clarify the concept and emphasize its important role in guidance in practices through reviewing relevant literatures published in SSCI journals. Furthermore, we propose a multilevel theoretical framework to examine the influence factors of disruptive innovation by integrating various research results. We also provide suggestions and implications for future research."
,,,"In recent years, Bitcoin exchange rate prediction has attracted the interest of researchers and investors. Some studies have used traditional statistical and econometric methods to understand the economic and technology determinants of Bitcoin, few have considered the development of predictive models using these determinants. In this study, we developed a two-stage approach for exploring whether the information hidden in economic and technology determinants can accurately predict the Bitcoin exchange rate. In the first stage, two nonlinear feature selection methods comprising an artificial neural network and random forest are used to reduce the subset of potential predictors by measuring the importance of economic and technology factors. In the second stage, the potential predictors are integrated into long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict the Bitcoin exchange rate regardless of the previous exchange rate. Our results showed that by using the economic and technology determinants, LSTM could achieve better predictive performance than the autoregressive integrated moving average, support vector regression, adaptive network fuzzy inference system, and LSTM methods, which all use the previous exchange rate. Thus, information obtained from economic and technology determinants is more important for predicting the Bitcoin exchange rate than the previous exchange rate."
,,,"Traceability has become an important feature in supply chain management. It can be adopted to identify the sources of many quality problems. In this paper, we develop a game theoretical model to study the role of traceability in combating product label misconduct. Specifically, we consider an industrial organization that assigns product labels to its members to certify their products in an output market. However, a member of the organization may choose to sell its product label to an unregulated party that makes unqualified units. The organization can choose between a traceable product label system and an untraceable one. The former has the advantage of identifying the responsible member when the inspection detects an unqualified unit. We derive the optimal inspection polices of the two product label systems and demonstrate that the organization may incur a higher cost by adopting the traceable rather than untraceable label system. This non-intuitive result indicates that without a proper management mechanism in place, the adoption of a traceable product label system may backfire. We extend our base model and show that our main insights are robust in various settings."
,,,"Reimagining energy infrastructures for the 21st century increasingly means choosing between competing economic futures, a dilemma that is now provoking conflicts across many places and realms. In the United States, one critical clash is unfolding among tech sector advocates for a clean energy transition, as U.S. cleantech has worked to regroup from Silicon Valleyâ€™s failed clean energy manufacturing push of the late 2000s and to navigate an ongoing solar trade war with China: about what that transition might look like, how it might be achieved, and, critically, what economic sectors and rents might emerge from it. One set of entrepreneurs and venture capitalists argues that â€œbreakthroughâ€ clean energy technologies are needed to produce an energy transition and to bolster U.S. economic power into the 21st century. Meanwhile, a competing set prioritizes deploying existing technologies and infrastructures at scale. The latter argues that new kinds of innovation can accomplish this task, and in the process defend embattled U.S. hegemony: notably, so-called financial innovation, and new articulations between finance and high tech. This debate has major implications for the nature and global politics of a green economy."

,,,"In the current business and political climate, deliberations concerning international trading agreements and their importance to B2B firms are increasing. Although the volume and value of international exchanges are growing, this study reveals that literature exploring issues concerning B2B international business, and particularly the role technological advancements play supporting B2B cross-border trade, is limited. This paper provides an overview of research contributions published in the Industrial Marketing Management (IMM) journal in order to reveal the current state of knowledge, identify research gaps, and propose further research directions. Following a two-stage approach, we reveal that although â€˜tradeâ€™ is at the heart of IMM research, there is a scarcity of empirical studies examining technological advancements and B2B international, as well as local, trade; some attention, however, has been placed on the exploration of B2B international trade issues. Building on our findings, we propose future research directions."
,,,"The transition to renewables is being driven by cities, as they are where economic growth is happening. The decoupling of fossil fuels from growth in economic activity is shown to have been proceeding rapidly for most of this century, and is analyzed globally in terms of structures and technologies for energy efficiency and for switching to renewable energy. This is examined for the fall in coal and the fall in oil in terms of urban economies across the world. The evidence suggests the changes are based on demand for the structures and technologies that are emerging. The renewable cities revolution can therefore be expected to accelerate."
,,,"In the modern business environment, consumers are increasingly influenced by megatrends involving marketplace, technology, socioeconomics, geopolitics, and natural environment. Simultaneously, the data and insights that can inform consumer attitudes and behaviors often reside outside of firms' direct control. Consciously incorporating these interdependent factors into firms' decision-making is essential for adaptability and sustainable profitability. Building on the â€œoutside-inâ€ perspective, we propose that firm strategies should be informed through the lens of the marketing ecosystem that considers the interrelated and dynamic megatrends. By leveraging advances in data and technology, firms can sense-make the marketplace by extracting insights from massive amounts of diverse consumer data with modern-day analytics. By mapping out the megatrends with marketing analytics, firms can 1) more accurately predict consumers' changing preferences and formulate appropriate strategies to engage with them; and 2) become more market-adaptable and competitive in the present and the future. To deliver sustainably compelling value to customers, firms should adopt an ecosystem mindset and cooperate with various stakeholders. A broad-thinking, agile, and humble firm culture can enable the development of more robust outside-in capabilities. We elaborate on the megatrends in the interconnected world of the marketing ecosystem, and propose emerging research directions in each area."
,,,"The blockchain has received significant attention from technology focussed researchers, highlighting its perceived impact and emerging disruption potential, but has been slow to engender any significant momentum within the Information Systems (IS) and Information Management (IM) literature. This study approaches the subject through an IS/IM lens developing the key themes from the blockchain based research via a comprehensive review. This analysis of the body of literature highlights that although few commercial grade blockchain applications currently exist, the technology demonstrates significant potential to benefit a number of industry wide use cases. This study expands on this point articulating through each of the key themes to develop a detailed narrative on the numerous potential blockchain applications and future direction of the technology, whilst discussing the many barriers to adoption. The study asserts that blockchain technology has the potential to contribute to a number of the UN Sustainability Development Goals and engender widespread change within a number of established industries and practices."
,,,"The advent of blockchain technology and the increasing penetration of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems have presented a new opportunity for peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading. In such transactive markets, communities may enjoy cheaper electricity prices while supporting locally produced green energy. However, there exists a considerable knowledge gap between market mechanisms and energy exchanges. Challenges arise in the auction process to ensure individual rationality, incentive compatibility, budget balance, and economic efficiency. This paper offers insights for building the foundation of a P2P energy trading market and presents a comparative analysis of auction mechanisms and bidding strategies for P2P solar electricity exchanges in terms of market demand and supply metrics. Auction mechanisms considered in this paper are Discriminatory and Uniform k-Double Auction (k-DA). Impacts of different bidding strategies, including game theoretic approaches, on the economic efficiencies of the P2P transactive energy market are also studied. A simulation case study of 100 participants in a microgrid at various PV penetration levels is presented using typical residential load and solar PV generation profiles."
,,,"This review advances the discussion about the future of laboratory medicine in the 2020s. In five major topic areas: 1. the â€œbig pictureâ€ of healthcare; 2. pre-analytical factors; 3. Analytical factors; 4. post-analytical factors; and 5. relationships, which explores a next decade perspective on laboratory medicine and the likely impact of the predicted changes by means of a number of carefully focused questions that draw upon predictions made since 2013. The â€œbig pictureâ€ of healthcare explores the effects of changing patient populations, the brain-to-brain loop, direct access testing, robots and total laboratory automation, and green technologies and sustainability. The pre-analytical section considers the role of different sample types, drones, and biobanks. The analytical section examines advances in point-of-care testing, mass spectrometry, genomics, gene and immunotherapy, 3D-printing, and total laboratory quality. The post-analytical section discusses the value of laboratory medicine, the emerging role of artificial intelligence, the management and interpretation of omics data, and common reference intervals and decision limits. Finally, the relationships section explores the role of laboratory medicine scientific societies, the educational needs of laboratory professionals, communication, the relationship between laboratory professionals and clinicians, laboratory medicine financing, and the anticipated economic opportunities and outcomes in the 2020's."
,,,"Sustainability issues pervade the supply chain deep into the recesses of various global regions and resources. Supply chains can become quite complex as they form multiple tiers of organizations and across networks. Solving anthropocentric pressures on the environment and human society means compelling supply chains to alleviate their environmental and social burdens. The strategic and operational complexities of multi-tier supply chain sustainability are transcendent. Addressing these concerns is still in its relative infancy amongst business, engineering, and production economics solutions. It is within this environment that this special issue in the International Journal of Production Economics advances this important research stream. Twenty-three articles using multiple methodologies, theories, and developments provide insights, clarifications and potential solutions to some of the most pernicious problems of multi-tier sustainable supply chains. This editorial overviews the various contentions, study interrelationships, whilst providing some future research directions."
,,,"Supply chain finance (SCF) aims to optimally align financial resource flows with material and information flows within supply chains. Although an increasing number of studies have demonstrated the potential of SCF resulting in improving cash-flow management and obtaining loan opportunities for suppliers and buyers, little is known about whether SCF initiatives can result in positive market value for service providers. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to examine the effect of SCF initiatives with the distinctive characteristics (that is, firm characteristic, collaborative mechanism, and service type) on service providersâ€™ market value. We adopted the event study methodology to analyse 177 SCF initiatives announced between 2008 and 2018 (Quarter 1) in the Chinese market. The event study results showed that the average abnormal returns over a three-day event window around the SCF announcements are 0.793%, representing an average increase of CNY 1.66 billion in market value for the service providers. Moreover, we found that such increase in market value is significantly higher when the SCF initiatives are announced by non-bank investors (e.g., fintechs), when the service providers collaborate to provide SCF services, and when the service providers upgrade existing SCF services rather than introduce new SCF services. As the market value of an SCF announcement is evaluated with several essential characteristics examined to understand which types of service providers and initiatives are considered to be the most valuable service offerings, this study offers important insights to SCF practitioners and supply chain stakeholders."

This paper summarizes the panelistsâ€™ prepared remarks.
,,,"The purpose of this paper is to understand changes in the technological competitiveness of countries induced by Internet of Things (IoT)-driven digitization. Patent analysis, as one of the best ways to measure technological competitiveness, exhibits three characteristics of IoT-driven digitization, namely, agile innovation, stagnation across Asian countries, and the resurgence of the U.S., in turn taking advantage of network effects. The agile innovation of IoT-driven digitization suggests that digitization relies less on existing technologies and enables the leveraging of opportunities that arise from new order emergence. Some Asian countries took advantage of agile innovation as a window of opportunity in the previous age of digitization. These countries now lag less behind the U.S. as a result. Nevertheless, as these countries experience difficulties in taking advantage of agile innovation in the current age of digitization, they lag further behind the U.S. in terms of IoT-driven digitization. The structure of joint patent applications reveals that the U.S. has become a hub between the two European communities, the Chinese community and individual pro-American countries, implying that the network effect of IoT-driven digitization could have a significant impact on the technological competitiveness of countries."
,,,"Inspired by the insurgence of the decade-old cryptocurrency market and its gradual acceptance into mainstream finance, this paper examines the evolving dynamic characteristics of the new currencies, in the midst of diverse emerging assets of the BRICS. We test for chaos in the time and scale return samples using LLE estimations. Our results accept (reject) chaotic structure for almost all the markets at the weekly (full and intraweek) data samples, and further found no copious disparity amongst the dynamic structure of the markets, contrary to the widely reported weak connectedness and somehow isolated cryptocurrencies from other financial assets. The findings hold implications for asset return forecasting, investment risk and regulatory policy."

,,,"This paper addresses how servitization is facilitated by the adoption of digital technologies and presents a review of the literature on this subject. The paper aims to characterise the phenomenon of â€˜digital servitizationâ€™ by examining how the literature describes the convergence between servitization and digital technologies as well as to identify areas for future research developments. The systematic review of the available scientific literature revealed limited but rapidly growing coverage of the phenomenon by scientific studies, which have mainly focused on the role of a few digital technologies (above all, the Internet of Things), studied in isolation. The research has mainly adopted an empirical, case-based methodological approach, mostly investigating the industrial equipment, automotive, and IT industries and focusing on the role of digital technologies for the implementation of intermediate and advanced services. This picture calls for future research endeavours to extend the scope of investigation into digital servitization (regarding the technologies covered and their combinatory effect, the potential benefits, and the application domains) and to develop models and frameworks to support decision-making by practitioners."
,,,"Cultural nuance, human behaviour and social identity require greater attention within the emerging smart city phenomenon. This special issue critically considers identity and urban culture as central to the smart city challenge. Current discourse on smart cities is obsessed with technological capability and development. Global rankings reduce cities to a one-dimensional business model and series of metrics. If the term â€˜smart cityâ€™ is to have any enduring value, technology must be used to develop a city's unique cultural identity and quality of life for the future. The editorial reviews emerging research on the cultural dimensions of urban innovation and smart cities and places the six special issue papers within a theoretical context. Each paper critiques smart city theories in relation to the practical challenge of enhancing urban identity, quality and value at a range of scales and geographic contexts. Three main themes are used to frame the debate on smart cities and urban innovation: 1) local development histories, 2) face-to-face relationships and 3) local community scales. Each of these themes is lacking in current smart city approaches and requires innovative approaches to integrate into the smart city of tomorrow."

,,,"This study addresses the effects of the firmâ€™s level of engagement with trade associations located at the companyâ€™s export market on export performance. It analyzes firm-level data from a South American emerging economy, Chile. Results show that a stronger engagement with trade associations located at the companyâ€™s export market has a positive effect on export performance. Environmental uncertainty on customer needs is confirmed as an export performance barrier, but unexpectedly, this obstacle only diminishes in a negligible factor as the level of engagement with trade associations located at the firmâ€™s export market increases. This study contributes to the international management literature by investigating the direct and moderating effects of overseas trade associations on the firmâ€™s export performance, and by scrutinizing on the distinctions among the cooperation determinants of local networks and networks situated at the firmâ€™s export market. Practical implications are discussed."
,,,"Entrepreneurship has gained increasing research attention in recent years. Although researchers largely agree the importance of innovation in the process of entrepreneurship, little research explores how the emerging innovation approaches can facilitate the above process. Furthermore, there is a lack of studies on entrepreneurship adopting the open platform strategy in light of the digital evolution. To address this research gap, this study investigates how entrepreneurs can take advantage of the platform-based innovation ecosystem in the entrepreneurial process. First, the study discusses various platform-based innovations for entrepreneurs and elaborates on the implementation with examples and practices. Accordingly, the study demonstrates a framework which categorizes these innovation platforms to fulfill the needs at two pivotal stages of the innovation process (i.e. invention and commercialization) for entrepreneurs. The study also discusses the concerns and issues an innovation platform ecosystem may bring forth for entrepreneurs. Finally, the study proposes a number of topics that merit further research. This study represents the first effort to categorize online platforms and develop an innovation process-based framework of platforms for entrepreneurs."
,,,"This study aims to investigate the effects of relative advantage, complexity, upper management support, cost, market dynamics, competitive pressure and regulatory support on blockchain adoption for operations and supply chain management among Small-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia. Unlike existing studies that employed linear models with Technology Acceptance Model or United Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology that ignores the organisational and environmental factors, we adopted the Technology, Organisation and Environment Framework that covers the technological dimensions of relative advantage and complexity, organisational dimensions of upper management support and cost and environmental dimensions of market dynamics, competitive pressure and regulatory support. Empirical data from 194 SMEs were investigated and ranked using a nonlinear non-compensatory PLS-ANN approach. Competitive pressure, complexity, cost and relative have significant effects on behavioural intention. Market dynamics, regulatory support and upper management support were insignificant predictors. SMEs often lack resources for technological investments but faces same requirements for streamlining business processes to optimise returns and blockchain presents a viable option for SMEsâ€™ sustainability due to its features of immutability, transparency and security that have the potential to revolutionise businesses. This study contributes new knowledge to the literature on factors that affect blockchain adoption and justifications were discussed accordingly."
,,,"Information Technology (IT) infrastructure has been integral to operational excellence approaches towards sustainable supply chains. The paper explores the crucial barriers to IT implementation in the largely unorganized logistics sector of an emerging economy, India. Through a comparative study using two separate expert-groups, representing the organized and unorganized logistics sectors respectively, the paper analyses their views on the criticality of barriers in each sector and highlights the sector-specific problems that hinder effective IT implementation. Considering the profiles of the expert groups used, the paper implements Fuzzy-ISM and Fuzzy-MICMAC analysis for one group and IRP for the other to capture and analyze their opinions appropriately. The results obtained from the analyses show that the barriers concerning IT implementation in the unorganized logistics sector (ULS) substantially differ from those concerning the organized logistics sector (OLS) as perceived by the corresponding sector experts. The study ranks the barriers in the two sectors and highlights the focus areas that require immediate attention to strengthen the IT infrastructure of Indian ULS, which suffers mainly from behavioral issues at the organizational level. Focused attention to unorganized sectorâ€™s requirements can revive the sector and smoothen its transformation to an organized one as exceedingly demanded by the recent e-commerce boom. The work is perhaps the first to address the Indian ULS. It implements a unique approach: seeks inputs from two different expert groups, implements tools appropriate to the respective panel profiles, and compares their opinions to identify the specific and different requirements of the Indian ULS with respect to IT implementation."
,,,"The rapid growth in information technology and related talent has let to a competition among the investors to look for the best available talent. Additionally, the diverse range of directions in technology, gives a lot of options to the applicants to choose from. In such a scenario, it is imperative to link the most appropriate investors and developers in a secure and cost optimal way. Blockchain technology helps in creating a decentralized network of users where the transactions are recorded in an open distributed ledger. These features of blockchain enable a transparent and cost-effective platform for different applications. Based on the need to an effective crowdfunding platform for developing smart nation and the inherent features of blockchain technology, we propose a global crowdfunding platform called BitFund. Investors and developers can act as different nodes of the network. The investors can request a specific project and they can give their initial bid value in terms of time, cost and maintenance required. Different developers can bid with different values of the same parameters to get the project ownership. A smart contract is deployed between the investors and the developers to reach an optimal solution for the investors. Multiple iterations of bidding are carried out between the developers until the optimal solution or equilibrium is reached. The experimental results show that the proposed model yields better results as compared to other generic algorithms for crowdfunding."
,,,"The shutdown in February 2015 of the Hong Kong Bitcoin exchange, MyCoin, added new proof to the already rich group of those claiming that Bitcoin is nothing more than a vector facilitating not only financial crime but crime in general. However, Bitcoin as well as other cryptocurrencies are the pioneers of a new economy that will address many of the current issues of digital trade including intellectual property rights, company shares, etc. As a new financial tool with financial value and features of both a commodity and a currency, cryptocurrencies are currently not fully understood and not covered by full-fledged regulation. Therefore, cryptocurrency is used in many financial crimes. Some of the crimes are it as a support for dissimulating classic crimes (e.g., money laundering, silkroad.com payments, etc.). Other crimes are specific to cryptocurrencies like double spending, Ponzi schemes, on crypto-investment, electronic theft, and so on. Tackling cryptocrime is a task similar to taking a close picture of the horizon. Even when Bitcoin and other versions are regulated, new ways of circumventing cryptocurrencies will emerge."

,,,"We assess whether the long-run volatilities of Bitcoin, global equities, commodities, and bonds are affected by global economic policy uncertainty. Empirical results provide evidence supporting this hypothesis, except in the case of bonds. For Bitcoin investors, the results imply the ability to use information about the state of global economic uncertainty to enhance the predictions of Bitcoin volatility. We further examine whether the correlation between Bitcoin and global equities, commodities, and bonds are affected by global economic policy uncertainty. Empirical results reveal that global economic policy uncertainty has a negative significant impact on the Bitcoin-bonds correlation and a positive impact on both Bitcoin-equities and Bitcoin-commodities correlations, suggesting the possibility of Bitcoin acting as a hedge under specific economic uncertainty conditions. Interestingly, the hedging effectiveness of Bitcoin for both global equities and global bonds enhances slightly after considering the level of global economic policy uncertainty. Such a weak effect of the state of global economic uncertainty on the hedging ability of Bitcoin implies that investors cannot substantially enhance the hedging performance of Bitcoin under different economic uncertainty conditions."
,,,"In emerging markets, there are data quality problems. In this paper, we establish theoretical models to explore how data quality problems affect sustainable fashion supply chain operations. We start with the decentralized supply chain and find that poor data quality lowers supply chain profit and social welfare. We consider the implementation of blockchain to help and identify the situation in which blockchain helps enhance social welfare but brings harm to supply chain profitability. We propose a government sponsor scheme as well as an environment taxation waiving scheme to help. We further extend the study to the centralized supply chain setting."
,,,"The business world is continually changing. Dynamic environments, full of uncertainties, complexities, and ambiguities, demand faster and more confident decisions. To compete in this environment, Industry 4.0 emerges as an essential alternative. In this context, the reliability of manufacturing is an essential aspect for companies to make successful decisions. In the literature, several technologies associated with Industry 4.0 have been applied to improve the availability of equipment, including the Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), blockchain, and data mining. Nevertheless, there is still no survey study that seeks to show how reliability has collaborated to support decision-making in organizations, in the context of Industry 4.0. In general, most applications still focus on the productivity and health of individual equipment. However, in today's volatile and complex businesses, local decisions are no longer sufficient; it is necessary to analyze the organization entirely. Thus, being aware of the impacts that a local failure can impose on the entire company has significant weight in the decision-making process. In this context, this article presents a survey to identify how researches on systems reliability has contributed to and supported the development of decision-making in Industry 4.0. The main contribution of this article is to highlight how reliability can be used to support different types of strategic decisions in the context of Industry 4.0. Finally, it highlights the need for research associating management decisions with the technologies of Industry 4.0."
,,,"In order to improve the corporate sustainability of agro-food value chains, business organizations need to rely on a higher performing and more reliable logistics system. Particularly, in case of dairy industry, organizations are facing some important challenges containing people management, short shelf life, high food losses and wastage, high greenhouse gas emissions. Based on â€œConfederation of Indian industry - Dairy Vision 2025â€, it is believed that the dairy sector in India has high potential if organizations can develop an effective logistics and supply chain system. This article attempts to analyze the interaction between distribution related challenges with a focus operational excellence and higher corporate green growth and sustainability viewpoints in food supply chains by considering the business example of four Indian dairy product based organizations using graph theory and matrix approach. Several key challenges were identified based on a literature survey and expertsâ€™ views. Graph theory and matrix approach has been applied to select the most significant challenge. The results show that food organizations must work on cold chain to manage logistics and distribution challenges to reduce wastage, decrease financial losses and to take environmental issues into account. This paper ranks the challenges as well as develop an index for the dairy industry to achieve corporate sustainability in its supply chain and logistics network. The present study findings will provide useful knowledge for managers and policy makers managing interaction between people and process aspects and corporate sustainability management in the agro-based diary organizational logistics and supply chains. This is one of the unique studies in food supply chain that helps in improving the logistics and supply performance in diary industries of emerging economies."
,,,"Humans communicate their activities and performance in several ways (word of mouth, signs, written language, webpage, social networks, etc.). Currently, businesses use different mechanisms to communicate their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities to foster their reputation, consumer loyalty and social recognition. Meanwhile, sceptic firms use CSR communication as a mere whitewashing strategy. Using a triangulation methodology for Spanish quoted firms (IBEX-35), this paper aims to identify the main CSR communication channels. Our study concludes that CSR communication will undergo constant change due to the evolution of communication mechanisms."
,,,"The convergence of technology and the city is commonly referred to as the â€˜smart cityâ€™. It is seen as a possible remedy for the challenges that urbanisation creates in the age of global climate change, and as an enabler of a sustainable and liveable urban future. A review of the abundant but fragmented literature on smart city theories and practices, nevertheless, reveals that there is a limited effort to capture a comprehensive understanding on how the complex and multidimensional nature of the drivers of smart cities are linked to desired outcomes. The paper aims to develop a clearer understanding on this new city model by identifying and linking the key drivers to desired outcomes, and then intertwining them in a multidimensional framework. The methodological approach of this research includes a systematic review of the literature on smart cities, focusing on those aimed at conceptual development and provide empirical evidence base. The review identifies that the literature reveals three types of drivers of smart citiesâ€”community, technology, policyâ€”which are linked to five desired outcomesâ€”productivity, sustainability, accessibility, wellbeing, liveability, governance. These drivers and outcomes altogether assemble a smart city framework, where each of them represents a distinctive dimension of the smart cities notion. This paper helps in expanding our understanding beyond a monocentric technology focus of the current common smart city practice."
,,,"The logistics and supply chain management (SCM) field is experimenting with the integration of blockchain, a cutting-edge, and highly disruptive technology. Yet, blockchain is still nascent, and the extant literature on this technology is scarce, especially as regards the relationship between blockchain and SCM. Additionally, existing studies have not yet addressed sufficiently the enablers of blockchain adoption and the interplay with supply chain performance. In order to reduce this gap, this study aims to examine the potential influence of blockchain on supply chain performance. We draw on the literature on technology adoption and supply chain performance, as well as on the emerging blockchain literature, to develop and test a model in two countries, namely India and the US. Accordingly, we administered a survey in order to review the opinions and views of supply chain practitioners. The results support the model and indicate that blockchain applications can improve supply chain performance. In particular, our findings suggest that knowledge sharing and trading partner pressure play an important role in blockchain adoption, and that supply chain performance is significantly influenced by supply chain transparency and blockchain transparency. Another finding was the inexistence of evidence for a moderation effect of the industry variable on the outcomes. The research conclusions have substantial managerial and theoretical implications. Our model contributes mainly to the theoretical advancement of SCM-blockchain, thus allowing scholars to adapt our validated model."
,,,"As far back as the industrial revolution, significant development in technical innovation has succeeded in transforming numerous manual tasks and processes that had been in existence for decades where humans had reached the limits of physical capacity. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers this same transformative potential for the augmentation and potential replacement of human tasks and activities within a wide range of industrial, intellectual and social applications. The pace of change for this new AI technological age is staggering, with new breakthroughs in algorithmic machine learning and autonomous decision-making, engendering new opportunities for continued innovation. The impact of AI could be significant, with industries ranging from: finance, healthcare, manufacturing, retail, supply chain, logistics and utilities, all potentially disrupted by the onset of AI technologies. The study brings together the collective insight from a number of leading expert contributors to highlight the significant opportunities, realistic assessment of impact, challenges and potential research agenda posed by the rapid emergence of AI within a number of domains: business and management, government, public sector, and science and technology. This research offers significant and timely insight to AI technology and its impact on the future of industry and society in general, whilst recognising the societal and industrial influence on pace and direction of AI development."
,,,"In the Middle East, the most water-stressed part of the world, the water resources and water quality are severely affected by the climate change and the global warming, leading to frequent droughts and depleted water reserves. The low rainfall and desertification cause serious political instability, exacerbating the likelihood of failed states in this volatile region. The extreme climate coupled with mismanagement of water resources and inadequate infrastructure, deprive the growing population of safe drinking water, food, shelter, and stability, as reflected by the erupted 2011 â€œArab Springâ€ and the on-going Iraq, Syrian, and Yemen civil wars which enflamed migration and dislocation of population with widespread consequences. Against this background, the region is to promote sustainable management of water resources, incorporating advanced and innovative technologies to support water demand management, adopting good governance, social empowerment, and the protection of aquatic ecosystems. Advanced water conservation, consumption administration, data management and public participation, as already available, supplemented by water reuse, recovery of resources and sea water desalination, expanding on early initiatives by prosperous countries, have yet to be practiced on a large scale, region-wide. For such desirable vision to materialize, cross border and upstream-downstream linkages, between riparian states, have to be addressed improving capacities and sharing experiences, based on water management systems fostered by UN, such as IWRM, 2030 Agenda and NBS, aiming to overcome the climate change and adapting to its consequences. The causes, impacts, and adaptation to climate change and mitigation measures, providing an integrated picture of water management and technological challenges are discussed in this chapter."
,,,"The lack of industrialization, inadequacy of the management, information inaccuracy, and inefficient supply chains are the significant issues in an agri-food supply chain. The proposed solutions to overcome these challenges should not only consider the way the food is produced but also take care of societal, environmental and economic concerns. There has been increasing use of emerging technologies in the agriculture supply chains. The internet of things, the blockchain, and big data technologies are potential enablers of sustainable agriculture supply chains. These technologies are driving the agricultural supply chain towards a digital supply chain environment that is data-driven. Realizing the significance of a data-driven sustainable agriculture supply chain we extracted and reviewed 84 academic journals from 2000 to 2017. The primary purpose of the review was to understand the level of analytics used (descriptive, predictive and prescriptive), sustainable agriculture supply chain objectives attained (social, environmental and economic), the supply chain processes from where the data is collected, and the supply chain resources deployed for the same. Based on the results of the review, we propose an application framework for the practitioners involved in the agri-food supply chain that identifies the supply chain visibility and supply chain resources as the main driving force for developing data analytics capability and achieving the sustainable performance. The framework will guide the practitioners to plan their investments to build a robust data-driven agri-food supply chain. Finally, we outline the future research directions and limitations of our study."
,,,"We empirically identify carry trade activities under the disguise of bitcoin transactions on USD and CNY bitcoin exchanges during the post global financial crisis period. Relying on variations of bitcoin exchange pairs and two policy shocks, we find the evidence of inflow capital control evasion. We show that the relative CNY to USD bitcoin price, indicating capital inflow volume, of those with high excessive currency conversion profit respond significantly more negatively to carry trade returns. Moreover, this relationship becomes significantly weaker when China tightens its regulations on bitcoin transactions."
,,,"This chapter examines how FinTech is breaking barriers to financial inclusion. It first traces the history of FinTech and its evolution both globally and in Africa. Then it reviews the impact of selected FinTech products in African countries. Several observations are noteworthy. First, mobile money facilitated by mobile technology stands out as the most successful innovation in extending financial inclusion in Africa. Second, the most promising innovation that has the potential to alleviate SME funding constraints is crowdfunding. However, this potential can only be realized by increasing internet access in Africa, the region with the lowest penetration. Finally, the chapter discusses the challenges facing the proliferation of FinTech investments in Africa."
,,,"Road transportation being a leading source of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, is now resulting a move away from the traditional internal combustion engine to electric vehicles (EVs), currently powered by battery technology. This paper examines end-of-first-life applications of EVs batteries in a low-carbon circular economy following global transition to EVs and net zero economy. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key actors within the EV industry in the UK. Drawing on Stahel closed-loop solutions, a qualitative analysis of the transcripts of these interviews revealed the need for business models towards coherent low-carbon circular economy of the value chains. This paper reveals a whole range of issues relating to: extraction of battery critical raw minerals (e.g. ethical concerns); manufacturing (e.g. lack of policy frameworks addressing value chain emissions); distribution and sale (e.g. gaps in circular built economy strategy and transition plan); use (e.g. lack of a functioning market for end-of-first-life batteries) as well as research and innovation (e.g. lack of infrastructure to deal with end-of-first-life cells). The views on policy weaknesses testifies to the need for close-loop business model to not only focus on recycling battery raw minerals or repurposing battery for energy storage applications. But, should consider many aspects of an innovative policy strategy and productâ€™s global value chain, accounting for: equitable jobs, critical raw minerals dependency, circularity governance and industry standards, protecting the natural environment, tackling emissions and ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns. The study highlights establishing key trade-offs within policy goals considering the global value chains, as well as, harnessing synergies between social, economic and environmental goals. The paper concludes that a low-carbon close-loop business model should integrate the triple objectives of making positive impact on people, planet and profit, and developed on the basis of legislation, collaboration, research, investment, and incentives guiding to achieve the Global Goals."
,,,"Industry 4.0 is expected to impart profound changes to the configuration of manufacturing companies with regards to what their value proposition will be and how their production network, supplier base and customer interfaces will develop. The literature on the topic is still fragmented; the features of the emerging paradigm appear to be a contested territory among different academic disciplines. This study assumes a value chain perspective to analyze the evolutionary trajectories of manufacturing companies. We developed a Delphi-based scenario analysis involving 76 experts from academia and practice. The results highlight the most common expectations as well as controversial issues in terms of emerging business models, size, barriers to entry, vertical integration, rent distribution, and geographical location of activities. Eight scenarios provide a concise outlook on the range of possible futures. These scenarios are based on four main drivers which stem from the expertsâ€™ comments: demand characteristics, transparency of data among value chain participants, maturity of additive manufacturing and advanced robotics, and penetration of smart products. Researchers can derive from our study a series of hypotheses and opportunities for future research on Industry 4.0. Managers and policymakers can leverage the scenarios in long-term strategic planning."
,,,"The emergence of artificial general intelligence and the global brain provides new opportunities for realizing humanity's long quest for a more utopian existence. One possibility is a more successful implementation of the state socialist vision of a centrally managed economy, possibly controlled by an AGI â€œNannyâ€ instead of a central committee of politicians. An alternative outcome, more in keeping with the original Marxist vision of the withering away of the state, may be the mutualist vision of organizing economic and social life along voluntary lines. A number of recent developments and new ideas may facilitate this outcome. The institution of the commons, in the past available only to small geographical communities, can now be used by global communities. Open collaboration and exchange networks facilitate voluntary cooperative activity by people at dispersed physical locations. Open Production Networks can make the most complicated economic exchanges transparent to consumers, allowing them to factor ethical and sociological considerations into their purchasing decisions. Offer Networks can help people with similar interests and complementary abilities to organize joint projects and organizations. Blockchain technologies could be used to create transparent currencies in which transactions can be done openly. These and other related technologies have the potential to humanize global economic interactions, giving them more emotional resonance, as increasing affluence lessens individual and societal preoccupation with maximizing economic gain."
,,,"Blockchain, the technology underlying bitcoin, is an emerging financial technology (FinTech) that is poised to have strategic impacts on organizations. Because it is a new phenomenon, there are few studies on blockchain, and those studies have focused mainly on the technologyâ€™s potential impacts, whereas how to effectively implement it in an organization remains unknown. Our study intends to fill that gap. Using affordance-actualization (A-A) theory as the theoretical lens, we conducted a case study of blockchain implementation in an organization that has effectively implemented it. We identify three affordances of blockchain in the organization and a process model whereby these affordances are actualized. The process model extends A-A theory by adding an experimentation phase where blockchainâ€™s use cases within the organization are identified, developed and tested through conceptual adaptation and constraint mitigation. Our study makes important theoretical contributions to the literature on A-A theory, blockchain, information technology (IT) implementation, and strategic information systems (SIS). Our study can also help IT practitioners to implement blockchain effectively and extract value from their investment."
,,,"There has been a growing consensus in promoting financial inclusion around the world in recent years, when the authorities in advanced and emerging economies have undertaken comprehensive measures to dodge the challenge of the expanding income inequality and mediocre growth."
,,,"The fourth industrial revolution, also labelled Industry 4.0, was beget with emergent and disruptive intelligence and information technologies. These new technologies are enabling ever-higher levels of production efficiencies. They also have the potential to dramatically influence social and environmental sustainable development. Organizations need to consider Industry 4.0 technologies contribution to sustainability. Sufficient guidance, in this respect, is lacking in the scholarly or practitioner literature. In this study, we further examine Industry 4.0 technologies in terms of application and sustainability implications. We introduce a measures framework for sustainability based on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals; incorporating various economic, environmental and social attributes. We also develop a hybrid multi-situation decision method integrating hesitant fuzzy set, cumulative prospect theory and VIKOR. This method can effectively evaluate Industry 4.0 technologies based on their sustainable performance and application. We apply the method using secondary case information from a report of the World Economic Forum. The results show that mobile technology has the greatest impact on sustainability in all industries, and nanotechnology, mobile technology, simulation and drones have the highest impact on sustainability in the automotive, electronics, food and beverage, and textile, apparel and footwear industries, respectively. Our recommendation is to take advantage of Industry 4.0 technology adoption to improve sustainability impact but each technology needs to be carefully evaluated as specific technology will variably influence industry and sustainability dimensions. Investment in such technologies should consider appropriate priority investment and championing."
,,,"Transition from Industry 3.0 to Industry 4.0, in other words Industry 3.5 stage, and moving to a circular economy are two significant concepts for organizations that need to make wholesale alterations to their current systems. In order to stay competitive, both these transitions need to follow sustainable resource management and digital transformation principles. However, there are barriers to these changes that organizations should consider. Both Industry 4.0 transition, in other words Industry 3.5, and circularity transition require great efforts to deal with these barriers; in the current environment, organizations need to deal with these barriers simultaneously for more sustainable resource management. This study focuses in particular on circular supply chains in the Industry 3.5 stage. There are some studies that suggest barriers to Industry 4.0 and circular supply chains separately, none of these studies consider them together. From this point of view, this study contributes to existing literature by presenting synchronized barriers that integrate circular supply chain and Industry 4.0 barriers. Firstly, pillars of circular supply chains in Industry 4.0 are explained; synchronized barriers are then presented. A decision-making method, Fuzzy Analytical Network Process, is used to prioritize the synchronized barriers, with theoretical and practical implications proposed according to the result of the implementation."
,,,"Through a conceptual note and round table discussion, this article builds upon Buckley and Prashantham's (2016) â€œdivision of entrepreneurial labourâ€ notion to consider more closely the perspective of multinational corporations (MNCs) in relation to partnering with startups. First, the capability dimension suggests that there is potential for value creation resulting from complementarity between the strengths of corporations and startups. Second, the connectivity dimension is concerned with how this potential is realised; the rise of corporationsâ€™ programmatic initiatives and third-party specialists are highlighted. Third, the contextuality dimension highlights spatial differences, noting MNCsâ€™ unique opportunities and challenges vis-Ã -vis startup partnering in emerging markets."
,,,"It is paradox that in globalized world more than one third of its population is excluded from formal financial system. The body of evidence suggests that appropriate financial services can help improve household welfare and promote small enterprises. The financial exclusion is attributed to various reasons. Conventional financial system has several inherent limitations which lead to unserved population. Digital currency and mobile technology can spur penetration of financial system partially in unserved population. The evidence shows that high cost for small ticket size financial transaction in conventional financial system makes the transactions unviable. Digital currency and mobile technology can cater the needs of small transaction at affordable cost. It can also help reducing time, more accurately and make faster transactions in bulk. Many emerging economies like India, Brazil, and Nigeria have embarked on mobile technology to overcome financial exclusion. This chapter sheds light on opportunities, challenges, solutions, global experience in floating digital currency, and using mobile technology for financial inclusion."
,,,"The digitalization phenomenon is leveraging new relationship models through the entire supply chain network. In this outlook, blockchain is a cutting-edge technology that is already transforming and remodeling the relationships between all members of logistics and supply chain systems. Yet, while studies on blockchain have gained a relative pace over the recent years, the literature on this topic does not report sufficient research cases on blockchain adoption behavior at the individual level. The present study, therefore, aims to bridge this gap, notably by helping understand the individual blockchain adoption behavior in the logistics and supply chain field in India and the USA. Drawing on the emerging literature on blockchain, supply chain and network theory, as well as on technology acceptance models (TAMs), we have developed a model based on a slightly-altered version of the classical unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). The model being developed was then estimated using the Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). As the model was eventually supported, the results obtained revealed the existence of distinct adoption behaviors between India-based and USA-based professionals. In parallel, the findings appear as a useful contribution to and a sign of progress for the literature on IT adoption, SCM, and blockchain."
,,,"The recent attention to the situatedness and spatiality of finance has consequences for understanding financial risks. The focus on geofinance and financial ecologyrequires investigation in risk interdependences at all levels (individual, institutional, and systemic) and across different countries and cultures. Financial risks relate to financial intermediation, execution of payments, financial protection, supply of financial products, and smooth functioning of money. Perception and management of these risks can be distorted by behavioral biases, institutional risk cultures, and interconnectedness within global financial networks. Modern financial technologies such as FinTech, RegTech, blockchain, and digital currencies pose new challenges for risk management."
,,,"Research conducted in the innovation field lags behind organizationsâ€™ general technological development and innovativeness. Literature that previously depicted innovation types in developed markets is markedly different from progressively publicized emerging market innovation types. While capital-abundant firms tend to engage in respective pioneering and incremental innovation loops, resource-constrained firms and firms in emerging countries may partially free-ride on existing products and services through innovations such as copycat and frugal. To date, there have been no attempts to holistically consolidate product and service innovation types into one overarching typology. Using novel methods of text mining and co-citation analysis, this study systematically maps three decades of product and service innovation scholarship to provide a typology of eight major product and service innovation types. This is further supported by case study analysis to demonstrate how these innovation types fit into the cost vs market novelty matrix. This study is unique in its methodological proposition to systematically review the innovation scholarship of more than 1,400 articles through comprehensive, quantified, and objective methods that offer transparent and reproducible results. The study provides some clarity regarding the classifications and characteristics of the innovation typology."
,,,"The prospects for a smart power system have been widely discussed in the global electricity sector. Decarbonization, Digitalization and Decentralization are considered the main key drivers for this power system transition and Brazil is no exception to this universal trend. A search of the literature revealed few studies which attempt to address the main challenges and opportunities towards a smart grid power system in Brazil. This paper provides an up-to-date assessment of the present and potential capabilities of existing and future technologies, regulations and policies and attempts to identify how these elements are interrelated. Our findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that policies for Distributed Generation (DG), Demand-Side Management (DSM) and new tariff schemes are on a path of accelerated deployment in the country. The deployment of storage technologies, however, is at a slow pace of growth. We highlight the need to further develop new business models to address the various decentralized energy technologies and services that are emerging in the sector. The current net-metering system is considered a key issue to be addressed as this regulatory structure may shift the costs from DG to non-DG users."
,,,"This study reviews the presence of articles related to Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) in Web of Science (WOS). Bibliometric analysis first reveals the trends of CEE-related articles in the areas of international business (IB), management and economics up to 2016. The results show steady growth in absolute and relative numbers after 1990, intensifying since 2010. Second, we conduct topic research using network analysis with blockmodeling. We identify a network of topics and their interrelations over time and used them to periodise the CEE-related research in IB. The most-cited CEE-related IB articles and the main citation path are also presented. The analysis adds to the discussion of how the CEE region is explored in IB research, its contributions, impacts and the challenges facing regional research in the future. In this study, a methodology and framework for performing a comprehensive bibliometric analysis on regional IB research is applied."
,,,"Decarbonization has driven the uptake of variable renewable energy resources, both utility scale and distributed. This is driving the development of new business models of how electricity is distributed and managed on the network. One such model, peer-to-peer trading, allows consumers, prosumers, and prosumagers to trade energy between themselves, both lowering costs while providing balancing services to the network. Enabling technologies such as blockchains can help build trust and track transactions efficiently, securely and at low cost. This chapter examines the factors governing successful deployment of such systems and technical and regulatory challenges."
,,,"In this study, we compare the safe-haven properties of Bitcoin, gold, and the commodity index against world, developed, emerging, USA, and Chinese stock market indices for the period 20 July 2010â€“22 February 2018. We apply the wavelet coherency approach and show that the overall dependence between Bitcoin/gold/commodities and the stock markets is not very strong at various time scales, with Bitcoin being the least dependent. We study the diversification potential at the tail of the return distribution through wavelet value-at-risk (VaR) and reveal that the degree of co-movement between gold and stock returns affects the portfolioâ€™s VaR level. Specifically, the benefits of diversification vary in the time-frequency space, with Bitcoin exhibiting a superiority over both gold and commodities. Our findings are useful for investors and financial advisors searching for the best asset among Bitcoin, gold, and commodities to hedge extreme negative movements in stock market indices, while accounting for the heterogeneity in the horizons of investors."
,,,"Recent advances in science mapping allowed to analyze the entire intellectual structure of blockchain and cryptocurrencies in business-related disciplines to identify 174 academic articles as well as 1482 practitioner-oriented articles published since the inception of cryptocurrencies in 2008 to highlight key trends of the published outputs. The results demonstrate academic research done by 389 authors in 296 organizations based in 50 countries that only just initiated the conversation on four major streams of the literatureâ€”Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies; blockchain adoption; cryptocurrency and blockchain environment; and business model innovations. When comparing academic scholarship to practitioner-oriented literature, the results demonstrate that practitioners discussed investor-related themes, cryptocurrency intrinsic value, political-economic sphere, and the impact of cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies on the wider society in greater detail. As a result, a number of themes are identified and discussed that could align academic and practitioner interests and provide guidance for further research in this important field."
,,,"Port Community Systems (PCS) are inter-organizational software platforms that connects port community actors, enabling commercial services and information exchange between the port to their customers and a variety of stakeholders. Our main motivation for this paper lies in the absence of surveys on the PCS literature, hence the purpose of this paper is to perform a structured literature review on PCS to establish promising research gaps. Such review was conducted surveying the literature about PCS from 2001 until 2019. The study introduces a detailed and current worldwide PCS inventory using a proposed evolution framework and a taxonomy, the latter built upon commonly cited factors from the IT systems development literature in the context of port communities, which are synthesized into three frames: a Business frame, an Integration frame, and a Legal frame. Findings show that literature on PCS is scarce and fragmented, oftentimes with PCS research published in non-specialized documents on the topic, with few comparative studies between countries and several countries receiving little attention. Few authors have high specialization on the topic while most authors in average contribute less than once to the body of knowledge. Additionally, it was found that industry is ahead of scientific research in terms of documenting PCS development and technical features. The results also show a lack of innovation regarding PCS research studies, which risks relegating PCS research to irrelevance. A major critique to extant PCS literature is about its inertia, as research tends to be excessively comfortable with the legacy PCS, neglecting its need to evolve and adapt to new markets (in response to the growth of emerging economies) or to extended functionalities (taking advantage of the surge of new technologies). Furthermore, it was found that the future of PCS research should aim for addressing practical needs, while fostering collaboration among practitioners and scholars."
,,,"This study examines the asymmetric volatility connectedness between Bitcoin and major precious metals markets (gold, silver, palladium, and platinum). We use high-frequency data with methodologies introduced by Diebold and Yilmaz (2014) and BarunÃ­k, KoÄcenda, and VÃ¡cha (2017). The results show evidence of significant volatility spillover effects between Bitcoin and precious metals. Moreover, the risk spillovers vary over time and are sensitive to slowdowns in economic activity and political events (e.g., the Brexit vote and the US presidential election). Palladium is the largest net contributor of spillovers while Bitcoin is a net recipient. Finally, evidence of asymmetry in semi-volatility transmission shows that Bitcoin heavily transmits net-positive spillovers to other assets. The results of our research are of interest and importance to investors, portfolio managers, and policy-makers, as the results can readily inform their decision-making."
,,,"The purpose of this study is to identify how Procurement 4.0 and digital transformations are related and how digital transformation impacts the intention to optimize the procurement process in the circular economy. The moderating effect of information processing capability is also investigated. We survey South African manufacturers and analyze survey results using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) approach to test the research hypotheses and our theoretical framework. Finally, a sample business process is simulated to evaluate how Industry 4.0 automation can influence organizational procurement process optimization and circular economy performance. The findings of this empirical study indicate that Procurement 4.0 strategy positively influences buyersâ€™ intention to optimize business processes. Second, Procurement 4.0 performance review positively influences buyersâ€™ intention to optimize business processes. Third, information processing capability moderates the effect of Procurement 4.0 performance review on buyersâ€™ intention to optimize business processes. Finally, buyersâ€™ intention to optimize business processes plays a key role in enhancing circular economy performance. The simulation results demonstrate the potential benefits from industry 4.0 applications in the procurement function in a circular economy."
,,,"This paper reviews the Academic Entrepreneurship literature according to the emergence of powerful Digital technologies, providing an overview of the state of research and outlining a future research agenda about Digital Academic Entrepreneurship. One hundred and sixty-five journal papers were initially extracted from Scopus and their content was analysed for the paper selection process by two researchers in parallel, plus a third one in case of uncertainty. Finally, fifty-nine papers dealing with digital academic entrepreneurship and published in a variety of academic journals have been analyzed through a content and a bibliometric analysis. Findings show that literature on Digital Academic Entrepreneurship is really scant and dominated by unrelated research. Content analysis provides the emergence of four major research streams: 1) Digital Technologies for Entrepreneurship Education; 2) The â€œmaker space movementâ€ for Academic Entrepreneurship; 3) Digital technologies for discovering entrepreneurial opportunities; 4) Creating entrepreneurial competences in the Digital â€œUniversity-basedâ€ Entrepreneurial ecosystems. The paper presents the first attempt to provide a comprehensive structured literature review of the disruptive role of digital transformation for the Academic Entrepreneurship. Despite the growing literature on Digital Entrepreneurship, this research area is still fragmented and undertheorized. More systematic and holistic studies, considering both the technological, economic and the social aspects of Academic Entrepreneurship are required."
,,,"We compare gold and Bitcoin for the G7 stock markets, finding that gold and Bitcoin have distinct safe haven and hedging characteristics. Gold is an undisputable safe haven and hedge for several G7 stock indices, whereas Bitcoin takes these two functions in Canada. The out-of-sample hedging effectiveness of gold is much superior to that of Bitcoin. Furthermore, we find that the conditional diversification benefits offered by gold to equity investments in the G7 markets are comparatively much higher and more stable than those of Bitcoin, especially in the lower return quantiles, i.e., when both the stock and gold markets are in a bearish state. Implications are further discussed."
,,,"This paper investigates the adaptive market hypothesis (AMH) with respect to the high frequency markets of the two largest cryptocurrencies â€” Bitcoin and Ethereum, versus the Euro and US Dollar. Our findings are consistent with the AMH and show that the efficiency of the markets varies over time. We also discuss possible news and events which coincide with significant changes in the market efficiency. Furthermore, we analyse the effect of the sentiment of these news and other factors (events) on the market efficiency in the high frequency setting, and provide a simple event analysis to investigate whether specific factors affect the market efficiency/inefficiency. The results show that the sentiment and types of news and events may not be significant factor in determining the efficiency of cryptocurrency markets."
,,,"To keep the planet on the 2Â°C trajectory, developing countries alone will require US$500 billion annually by 2030 to adequately mitigate their carbon emissions, in addition to several hundred billion additional dollars for adaptation needs. The US$100 billion a year pledged by developed countries through the Green Climate Fund is such insufficient that most of the climate finance required will have to come from the private sector. As a scene-setting chapter, it will delineate the scale of climate investment required, the state of climate finance post-Paris Agreement, climate mitigation and adaptation investment trends, global climate finance landscape, specific hurdles against climate investment, and the problems with climate finance tracking and monitoring. The lack of trust and transparency in the global climate finance landscape provides an excellent ground on which to deploy Blockchain technology to turbo-boost global climate finance flows. This chapter will initiate the discussion on how Blockchain as a â€œtrust machineâ€ could address the many deeply-rooted institutional problems."
,,,"Urban interfaces have undergone changes due to the population growth and business models brought about by the sharing economy. The sharing economy benefits many sectors of society. Sustainable practices, servitisation, and disruptive technologies work together with the sharing economy to improve the sustainable value chains. This research study proposes a sharing economy management framework with social and ecological approaches in urban interfaces. The literature review was developed between October 24th, 2018 and March 19th, 2019. The first stage of the search was based on the terms â€œshare OR sharingâ€ and â€œsustainability OR sustainable.â€ In the second stage, the search was based on the terms â€œshare OR sharingâ€ AND â€œsustainability OR sustainable.â€ Based on the literature review, the authors created seven sustainable sharing factors: landscape, mobility, knowledge, production and consumption, sustainable practices, digital, and geographical which are the foundations of the management framework. The connections between these sustainable sharing factors can help to create sustainable value chains. The authors conclude that this connection is based on the need for digital insertion and disruptive technologies, enabling the sharing of knowledge and the support of new transportation models. Sustainable practices also enhance this connection, encouraging responsible production and consumption together with other factors. This transformation impacts the variables of the landscape factor. The management framework presents the analysis of the sustainable sharing factors and the social and ecological approaches in the urban interfaces."
,,,"An extensive body of work investigates business phenomena from the capability perspective introduced by Teece, Pisano, and Shuen (1997). While several literature reviews on capabilities exist, research is still fragmented with ongoing debates between those trying to foster relevance and passionate critics in favour of rigour. This study contributes to the conversation by looking at how the community of scholars gathered around Industrial Marketing Management (IMM) has engaged with this body of work and, in turn, influenced other sub-communities. Specifically, using the CitNetExplorer software, we analyse all IMM capabilities-related publications and their direct influence on other journals. The findings unveil seven thematic clusters that highlight how IMM scholars have expanded capability research by deepening the understanding of its relational foundations. Our data not only reinforce prior warnings about weak validity, but also uncover signs that suggest that the IMM community is on a path of theoretical consolidation with potential benefits for the broader conversation."
,,,"The ever-increasing worldwide demand for automation has augmented the adoption of technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning for industrial developments. Among the recent technological advancements, intelligent robots are increasingly becoming an integral part of several firms. The study focuses on the impact of intelligent robots on productivity, competitiveness and how firms are leveraging automation. This study uses centering resonance analysis (CRA) to develop an empirically grounded understanding of the rationale for robotization, through secondary archived data. Through the content analysis of over 261 online published articles, we decipher the derived themes through the following theoretical frameworks: behavioral, economic, and operations management perspectives. The findings suggest that firms are leveraging the concept of robotization to increase performance, efficiency, and profit. The deployment of robots in various firm domains focuses on public welfare, consumer orientation, and a sustainable environment and agriculture."
,,,"The significance of uncertainty in policies related to economic decisions is higher than ever before in todayâ€™s interconnected world. This study contributes to existing research by reviewing the literature on the impact of economic policy uncertainty on corporations and economies worldwide. We show the importance of measuring and tracking uncertainty by highlighting its influence on financial decisions. We examine the growing number of studies that use the economic policy uncertainty index (EPU) of Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016) as a key factor in measuring uncertainty. We then review the impact of EPU on financial markets, macro and micro level, stock markets, corporate behavior, and risk management. Then, we document the asymmetric policy responses of economic uncertainty. Overall, policy uncertainty has a significant impact on firm financial policies as well as on consumer spending. Specifically, corporations act more conservatively during times of high uncertainty, thereby slowing investments in production and employment. In addition to the local effect of EPU, it spills over to other countries."
,,,"Blockchain technologies have captured the imagination of scholars, managers, and practitioners around the world. It is widely accepted by these actors that blockchain is not a buzzword, but a highly disruptive technology that is already remodeling the organizations and their supply chain business models. Despite the meaningful advance in the last years, blockchain applications regarding the operations and supply chain management (OSCM) are still in their infancy. Little is known about the role of blockchain in terms of operations traceability, as well in areas such as e-commerce, agriculture, public services, etc. Therefore, this Special Issue seeks to extend our understanding of blockchain applications in OSCM and how firms create and capture business value with blockchain. To this effect, this Special Issue will provide a well-articulated and in-depth discussion of the role of blockchain in creating value in the domain of OSCM. Specifically, it is expected that more light is shed on how blockchain integrates with and impacts new business models, transforms relationships, and improves performance and competitive advantage in OSCM. Also, the evolution of blockchain was reviewed in order to provide a strong background to the readers. The literature review was performed taking into account a bibliometric perspective of blockchain-related publications. The review supports the importance of this Special Issue by highlighting the urgent needs of this topic in this reputable journal. Finally, we provide future research directions and a guide for the papers presented in this Special Issue."
,,,"The energy poverty cycle continues to pose a major challenge for governments in emerging economies. Electrification has typically been delivered through centralised generation and distribution that has not always afforded equitable or efficient access. Decentralised solar technologies are fast approaching financial parity and have certain environmental advantages over grid extension, especially in rural and remote societies. We explore the emergence of decentralised energy systems in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India's most populated state with notable energy access and equity challenges. We suggest future electrification policies and strategies should be based on the principles of diversity in technology use, localised implementation and centralised planning and enforcement to address energy poverty conundrum in the state of Uttar Pradesh or similar economies."
,,,"This final chapter contemplates future trends and their likely impact on the production and use of milk proteins. We consider first global issues, including energy consumption, the global water economy, and specific issues for dairy relating to greenhouse gases. We then review current and emerging trends in consumer demands and how they might impact on the market for milk proteins. Important factors are expected to be food safety and traceability, competition from nonanimal sources, and an increasing concern for the effect of food on health, with the increasing importance of personalized nutrition. Finally, we consider some emerging technologies and how they might affect the future of milk protein production and processing."
,,,"In this article, we take stock of the ambivalent and contested nature of the sharing economy. Considering the â€˜sharing economyâ€™ as an umbrella construct and an essentially contested concept, we position the sharing economy as resting on three foundational cores: (1) Access economy, (2) Platform economy, and (3) Community-based economy. We show how each core holds distinct promises and paradoxes. This organizing framework shows how combining the cores can help sharing-economy initiatives to navigate certain tensions, but can also lead to new ones. We highlight the paradoxical nature of the sharing economy and make a case for balanced initiatives that combine the promises of each core while mitigating contradictions. We conclude by introducing the nine articles of the special issue, connecting their contributions to our organizing framework."
,,,"For over three decades now, several product companies around the world have been undertaking servitization paths. They have been devoting growing and substantial efforts to expand their service business. Expanding the service business in addition to their traditional core product business secures long-term growth and strengthens competitive advantages in business-to-business marketplaces. Recently, service business expansion has taken up many of the new digital technologies offered through the digital transformation. Thus, the servitization literature has progressed toward a dialogue on digital servitization . Against this background, the present article introduces the reader to this special issue. It first recalls key aspects of the emerging digital servitization discussion, and then depicts, through illustrative case studies, the growth paths utilized by industrial product companies when they take advantage of the digital servitization process. After discussing how the articles included in this special issue advance the literature, the article develops a number of directions for future research on digital servitization."
,,,"Global agricultural trade flows demonstrated a three-fold growth during the past decade particularly in emerging economies. At the same time, global food scandals in conjunction with the spillover effects in economy and society highlight the unreliability of existing food tracking systems and the inefficiency in monitoring food quality and fraud incidents across global food supply chains (SCs). Blockchain technology (BCT), which has already been successfully applied on the financial industry to validate critical transactions, seems to be a promising option. This research investigates a two-stage containerized food SC by implementing a demonstrator application at the Hyperledger Fabric framework. The study findings indicates that on one hand BCT has entered its maturity phase while on the other hand its adoption in food SC operations could add significant value by authenticating critical parameters and providing enhanced traceability . At the same time, BCT enabled by other digital technologies could allow for the optimization of global food SCs. Thus, BCT constitutes a promising digital technology that provides the capability to food SC stakeholders to securely share information, enhance process control and traceability and prevent potential risks."
,,,"International firmsâ€™ activities and structures have become highly complex as a result of managing a vast network of entities located around the world. Complex technology such as Additive Manufacturing or generally accepted as 3D printing has received universal interest. Economic growth in Vietnam generates unique infrastructure, logistics services and transportation challenges and opportunities. Logistics are a critically important priority in international trade, foremost in ongoing regional economic expansion. The main objective of this paper is to examine the impact and benefits of advanced technology, affecting logistics services and transportation in Vietnam. This research applied a descriptive survey methodology to gather primary empirical data on the awareness and the willingness to adapt to the technology of organizations focusing on opportunities for the Vietnam market. The results indicated that organizations have a positive attitude towards 3DP impact. The stronger influence was discovered on customization, new customer value proposition, the competitive advantage, and transportation and storage cost reduction. Vietnam is currently one of the most attractive emerging markets in the world. The findings from this research provide timely and valuable new insights into this phenomenon, as a potential mechanism for assisting the revolution of the transportation industry towards improving traffic congestion and pollution."
,,,"Circular Economy (CE) and the adoption of its principles globally are more important than ever to sustain the rate of production of goods and services to meet the ever-increasing consumer demand that is burdening the environment and society. This study investigates the adoption of CE principles amongst emerging economies as the challenges faced by these economies are generally different in terms of resource availability, varying government policies and consumer behaviour from those of developed economies. This research presents an empirically validated CE adoption model using a sample of 183 consumer responses. The study highlights the strong influence of factors such as consumer behaviour on the acceptance of remanufactured products and using products as a service to encourage the adoption of CE practices in emerging economies. This research offers businesses, consumers and policy makers insights into measures that have been taken by emerging economies that are in line with CE principles."
,,,"The integration of the maritime supply chain(s) is the subject of a general discussion. The last chapter reaches overarching conclusions and reflections from the integrated chain perspective by combining the findings from the preceding chapters. The next big challenge will be the transformation to (digitized) multicountry networked ecosystems. First, the last chapter gives an overview of the remaining key issues in maritime supply chains, hampering the transition from a linear maritime supply chain thinking toward a network industry. It furthermore provides solutions for handling those problems. Second, following Finger and Jaag 2015, the reshaping of the maritime supply chain is discussed from the industry, policy, and management perspectives. Last, some scenarios of how the industry should evolve from partner collaboration (one-to-one collaboration) to a maritime supply network (many-to-many collaboration) are discussed. From a business perspective, this trend of (maritime) actors banding together platform-enabled ecosystems can leverage their strengths and competitiveness."
,,,"The internet of things (IoT) enabled a common operating picture (COP) across the various applications of modern day living. The COP is achieved through the advancements seen in wireless sensor network devices that were able to communicate through the network thereby exchanging information and performing various analysis. In IoT, the exchange of information and data authentication is only done through the central server there by leading to the security and privacy concerns. Chances of device spoofing, false authentication, less reliability in data sharing could happen. To address such security and privacy concerns, a central server concept is eliminated and blockchain (BC) technology is introduced as a part of IoT. This paper elaborates the possible security and privacy issues considering the component interaction in IoT and studies how the distributed ledger based blockchain (DL-BC) technology contribute to it. Applications of BC with respect to focused sectors and category were clearly studied here. Various challenges specific to IoT and IoT with BC were also discussed to understand blockchain technology contribution."

,,,"This paper discusses the emergence of blockchain technology in the energy sector in the light of ongoing energy market transformation. The study builds on literature research and expert interviews, and provides insights into the future energy landscape in the context of the blockchain advent. While the interviewees acknowledge the great, though disruptive, potential of blockchain technology for the primary activities in the electricity sector, there is agreement that inflexible regulatory frameworks impose the biggest challenge. The widest impact which blockchain technology will have in the short-term will be in electric vehicle integration, while in the long-term blockchain will enable peer-to-peer microgrids. The role that the blockchain will play, though, relies mainly on the business model innovation in energy. While a growing body of literature discusses specific blockchain applications and solutions in an advanced technological set-up, this paper presents a holistic picture of the blockchain applicability in the energy sector and thematises this very powerful and versatile technology against the background of two emerging economies: South Africa and Russia."
,,,"Like many microfinance markets, the promises of microfinance institutions (MFI) have not been fully fulfilled in Indonesia due to high cost of operations and lack of sustainability, and impact of these programs. TBOP, a Singapore-based technology company that specializes in digital, data, and process design transformation technology, has developed financial technological (FinTech) solutions to empower MFIs to achieve operational efficiency and increased capacity so as to directly impact the lives of the poor. In addition, to address the funding institutions' growing demand for timely, comprehensive quantitative analysis of the Indonesia MFIs' progress, TBOP's FinTech solutions are designed with advanced data analytic features that measure the MFI clients' progress out of poverty and the MFIs' compliance to good practices. We discuss the key lessons learnt from TBOP's development experience and reflect on its implications for the future development of FinTech within the growing global MFI markets."
,,,"This chapter profoundly contextualises the emerging interplay between the process of diffusion of ICTs and, broadly defined, shifts in national welfare. It examines various aspects of the relationship of ICTs with social and economic development: why ICTs are treated as opportunity windows, why they are a prerequisite for socio-economic development, and how they can affect the performance of financial markets. It briefly discusses the channels through which growing access to and use of new ICTs can affect social, financial, and economic development of countries, and thus generate overall wealth."
,,,"This paper presents a case study on JD.com, one of the largest e-commerce platforms in China, to demonstrate how this online retailer enhances its competitive advantage by employing supply chain finance (SCF) practices to accelerate collaboration within the supply chain. Based on field interviews, this study investigates motivations and enabling factors for SCF adoption. Results show that JD adopts SCF mainly to strengthen its ecosystem and attain competitive advantage. In the sight of resource-based view and dynamic capability, JD builds an iterative process to conduct SCF practice. Enabling factors, mainly financial technology (fintech) and bargaining power, play critical roles in the decision-making process. The development of fintech facilitates the digitalization and capitalization process by improving transparency and efficiency while bargaining power influences the productization process. The adoption of SCF practice helps JD build closer partnership with supply chain partners and improves its own competitive advantage."
,,,"Social sustainability is a major concern in global supply chains for protecting workers from exploitation and for providing a safe working environment. Although there are stipulated standards to govern supply chain social sustainability, it is not uncommon to hear of businesses being reported for noncompliance issues. Even reputable firms such as Unilever have been criticized for production labor exploitation. Consumers now increasingly expect sellers to disclose information on social sustainability, but sellers are confronted with the challenge of traceability in their multi-tier global supply chains. Blockchain offers a promising future to achieve instant traceability in supply chain social sustainability. This study develops a system architecture that integrates the use of blockchain, internet-of-things (IoT) and big data analytics to allow sellers to monitor their supply chain social sustainability efficiently and effectively. System implementation cost and potential challenges are analyzed before the research is concluded."
,,,"Big data analytics and artificial intelligence, paired with blockchain technology, the Internet of Things, and other emerging technologies, are poised to revolutionise urban management. With massive amounts of data collected from citizens, devices, and traditional sources such as routine and well-established censuses, urban areas across the world have â€“ for the first time in history â€“ the opportunity to monitor and manage their urban infrastructure in real-time. This simultaneously provides previously unimaginable opportunities to shape the future of cities, but also gives rise to new ethical challenges. This paper provides a transdisciplinary synthesis of the developments, opportunities, and challenges for urban management and planning under this ongoing â€˜digital revolutionâ€™ to provide a reference point for the largely fragmented research efforts and policy practice in this area. We consider both top-down systems engineering approaches and the bottom-up emergent approaches to coordination of different systems and functions, their implications for the existing physical and institutional constraints on the built environment and various planning practices, as well as the social and ethical considerations associated with this transformation from non-digital urban management to data-driven urban management."
,,,"We derive the Bitcoin exchange rate dynamics by solving the exchange rate equation of the standard flexible-price monetary model to investigate any characteristics of Bitcoin like a currency. The dynamics is driven by an asymmetric mean-reverting fundamental shock which can be attributed to a money demand shock. A crash occurs when the exchange rate with a weakened mean-reverting force breaches a lower boundary where a smooth-pasting condition is imposed. The empirical results show the exchange rate dynamics can be calibrated according to the model, in which the mean reversion of the dynamics is positively co-integrated with the Bitcoin transaction volume indicating demand for Bitcoin; and with the risk reversals of the commodity currencies (Australian dollar and Canadian dollar) in currency option markets. The analysis shows that the Bitcoin exchange rate shares some characteristics of commodity currencies with crash risk. This suggests that Bitcoin behaves as a currency between fiat money and a crypto-commodity used for trading and investment purposes."
,,,"Climate change has a disproportionate impact on the worldâ€™s poor. Developing countries will require tens of billions of dollars in new funding annually to adapt to climate changes. Financial Technology (FinTech) and Blockchain innovations can play a major role in implementing these adaptation plans. Blockchain innovations can help build trust and transparency in international climate finance and could potentially have major implications in scaling and speeding up north-south, south-south, and peer-to-peer climate finance transfers. This chapter will explore the potential of Blockchain to provide scalable solutions in the areas of: tracking climate finance, results tracking, climate adaptation, financial inclusion, and identity. It will discuss requirements to achieve scale, including building the ecosystem by linking Blockchain developers, and funding sources with people working on problems of poverty. The big problems of our time need bold, collaborative solutions."

Articles classified as instructional resources and cases published in the same five journals during 2018 are listed in appendices categorized by the relevant content area."
,,,"Fintech holds boundless potential in the context of social inclusion. As new platforms and technologies are introduced to the market, and the boundaries of traditional business models are challenged, financial services can be provided with greater accountability, efficiency and accessibility. Ant Financial, China's largest Fintech company in the making, is set to revolutionize the China's financial network, including payment, wealth management and loans. It focuses on the underserved markets by the major Chinese banks: the low-income individuals, especially those in the rural areas. Ant Financial has leveraged on Taobao's platform, along with Alibaba's rural Taobao Strategy, to give out loans and help traditional agricultural business to set up shops on Taobao. Alibaba also introduced Taobao rural service centers, where villagers can get accustomed to making purchases and paying bills online, as well as picking up items they bought on Taobao. Alibaba provides computers and trains villagers to serve as its representatives in the centers, which are often in convenience stores. With Fintech advancements, access to products and financial services is becoming more accessible than ever. Ensuring a level playing field for consumers that live in rural locations or regions without the structures of an urban economy is vital in achieving full financial and social inclusion."
,,,"In an urban environment, people's daily traffic choices are reflected in emissions and the resulting local air composition, or air quality. Traffic contributes to the emissions of both carbon dioxide (CO2), affecting climate, and particulate matter (PM), affecting atmospheric chemistry and human health. While the development of city infrastructure is not in the hands of individuals, it is their transport mode choices that constitute traffic. In this scoping review we analyse 108 initiatives from around the world potentially influencing individual travel behaviour and producing changes in the shares of different transport modes (modal shifts). The targets, types and techniques of initiatives are identified. Examples of economic, regulative, structural and persuasive initiatives are included. Special focus is on whether the impacts on CO2 emissions, PM emissions and/or PM concentrations have been quantitatively evaluated, and on the quality and results of the evaluations. We observe that a variety of targets can motivate actions that lead to modal shifts and emission reductions. The results indicate that the level of atmospheric evaluations is low: absolute or relative changes in emissions and/or concentrations had been evaluated for only 31% (NÂ =Â 34) of the reviewed initiatives, with substantial heterogeneity in quality. Sanctions, such as congestion charge and restrictions, have more likely been evaluated in peer reviewed analyses than incentives. Scientific evaluations of impacts on ambient PM concentrations are especially scarce (NÂ =Â 4), although Air Quality is the primary target of 13% of actions and secondary target for at least 12%. We discuss the determinants of success and failure, when it comes to different types of initiatives, emission reductions and evaluations. A high-quality evaluation of atmospheric impacts captures the following: correct data about the modal shift (rate and direction), exclusion of external factors affecting the shift and emissions, and possible indirect impacts of the shift."
,,,"Blockchain is the latest â€˜disruptive innovationâ€™ that has caught scholarsâ€™ attention. It is the underlying technology for Bitcoin and other digital currencies. Stakeholders like developers, entrepreneurs, and technology enthusiasts claim blockchain has the potential to reconfigure the contemporary economic, legal, political and cultural landscape. Skeptics claim the concept and its applications remain ambiguous and uncertain. Business scholars began publishing studies on the emergence and impact of blockchain, bitcoin, and related projects in 2014. In this study, we conduct a PRISMA guided systematic review of blockchain research in the business literature from 2014 to 2018. Our results show a rapid increase of studies over the five year period. The findings also convey key insights about the current state of scholarly investigation on blockchain, including its top benefits and challenges for business and society. We found that blockchain remains an early-stage domain of research in terms of theoretical grounding, methodological diversity, and empirically grounded work. We suggest research directions to improve our understanding of the state of blockchain and advance future research of this increasingly important and expansive area."
,,,"The electricity system is in transition, but whereto? To large-scale global or regional grids or to self-sufficient disconnected prosumers? Although numerous studies have previously dealt with the future of the electricity system, there is a lack of studies that attempt to monitor the development of more complete sets of socio-technical system elements that support alternative futures. This paper addresses this gap by first identifying and characterizing three idealized electricity system futures: â€˜the Super-gridâ€™, â€˜the Smart-gridâ€™ and â€˜the Off-gridâ€™, and then using the characterization to monitor the emergence, accumulation and alignment of socio-technical elements indicating the initial formation of new systems. Besides tracing the ongoing structural build-up at the niche level, we explore how the emerging systems relate to the existing electricity regime, other sectors and discourses. While the final outcome is undecided, the findings indicate that all three of the investigated systems have gained momentum over the last decade, partly relying on growth trends in shared elements such as the rise of renewables and climate change concerns, but also building on different technologies, actor networks, related industries and political and cultural discourses."
,,,"In this commentary, we explore how blockchain is being leveraged to address the fundamental problems with market-based forest protection globally. In doing so, we consider the ways â€˜cryptocarbonâ€™ initiatives are creating new challenges that have so far escaped critical scrutiny. A blockchain is a distributed and immutable electronic database â€“ a ledger of every transaction that has ever taken place on a network, stored as cryptographically secured blocks, strung together in a chain. The technology is being increasingly hyped as applicable for a whole range of industries, social service provisions, and environmental management concerns. This includes the facilitation of natural asset market mechanisms, like Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). The original aim of REDD+ was to incentivise conservation, making tropical forests more valuable standing than cut down. Multiple factors, including lack of consumer interest, created an oversupply of carbon commodities. Ninety-five percent of the worldâ€™s avoided deforestation credits, representing millions of hectares of conserved forest, were stuck without a buyer. Several flagging REDD+ projects are now hoping that blockchain technology can carry them to new heights of market capitalisation. However, like with any powerful new technology, the benefits remain ambiguous."

,,,"This book is dedicated to essential strategies to build a world thriving in abundant and ubiquitous energy for all, based only on sunshine, wind, and water, powering and empowering our cities and communities from within at little or no resource cost, building local prosperity and strengthening security and social cohesion: a world in which energy is just no issueâ€”and the source of everyoneâ€™s wealth at the same time. This vision is still Utopian to some, but has become reality for others. The four enabling realms of design, technology, finance and planning inform the framing chapters for the book and its 33 contributions. The introduction ends with a narrative synopsis of each chapter and paper."
,,,"Blockchain technology could be transformational in democratizing global energy supply. This chapter offers three case studies on how this is beginning to happen, explores four central assertions, and offers the verdict that those who decide the rules will dictate if Blockchain is to successfully democratize global energy supply. The assertions are: firstly, centralized power equals magnified inequalities and less democracy, with energy supply currently overwhelmingly centralized; second, the paradox of the Internet is that by decentralizing participation, the Internet (via the â€œgiantsâ€ such as Apple, Google, etc.) centralizes authority; third, we must ensure both decentralized participation and authority if we are to fulfil the democratic promise of Blockchain technology. Last, energy supply is ripe for democratization by Blockchains. The three case studies demonstrating how Blockchains are already democratizing energy supply are LO3â€™s Brooklyn Microgrid, The Sun Exchange and SolarCoin."
,,,"This commentary explores how blockchain technology is being leveraged to improve marine conservation and fisheries supply chain management globally. In doing so, the paper considers the technical and political challenges of building trust and equity for various stakeholders. A blockchain is a smart electronic database, distributed to all users, immutably tracking every transaction that has ever taken place on the network. The blockchain is very difficult to hack, with no single point of authority to make mistakes and collapse the system. Automated consensus protocols enable data transmitted on the network to be verified and stored immutably, minimising the risk of data corruption to near-zero. Blockchain is being increasingly hyped for a range of services and industries, including transparent resourcing for marine conservation, reducing pollution from plastics, reducing slavery at sea, and sustainable fisheries management. Public distrust in some conservation operations, as well as in the provenance of seafood, is growing. Although some global marine conservation organisations and seafood producers have found practical solutions in disruptive technologies like blockchain, riding this wave will only prove worthwhile if coastal communities and artisanal fishers are on board and stand a chance of landing a fair share of the benefits."
,,,"This paper introduces a special issue of Aquaculture that brings together the largest collection of research on aquaculture value chains compiled to date, comprising 19 individual papers and this introductory review. The introduction identifies five themes emerging from research on aquaculture value chains in the special issue, namely: multi-polarity, diversity and scale, dynamics of transformation, performance and equity, and technical and institutional innovation. Contrary to much research to date, the papers addressing these themes show how the expansion of aquaculture has resulted highly diverse configurations of production for consumption in the global South. Collectively, the papers highlight the need for greater attention to neglected value chain segments and categories of actor, modes of production, regulation, and innovation, and patterns of access to benefits. The papers synthesized also affirm the need for more rigorous and diverse future value chain research to illuminate the aquaculture sector's ongoing development, and contribute to the sustainable expansion as an increasingly important component of the global food system."
,,,"The ocean is under threat. This is not only a scientific opportunity to describe problems. It is a partially unexplored opportunity to actively engage in change. A decade in the Nereus Program has provided a unique opportunity to better understand the past and present ways in which the ocean is managed, and has also helped develop a sense of where novel ways of engaging in governance can be productive and effective. This chapter explores recent developments in the understanding of ocean governance, and specifically explores fairness, potential shortcuts, and the role of science in ocean governance."
,,,"Over the past decade, two development programsâ€“cash transfer and financial inclusionâ€“were bundled in global development discourse. Despite differences in their purported objectives, cash transfers are increasingly delivered via financial inclusion infrastructures and technologies. One important yet under-appreciated consequence of this bundling is the possible transference of credit and debt to cash transfer recipients. In this paper, I explore how the South African cash transfer program incorporated recipients into a highly coercive and monopolistic financial system predicated on proprietary technologies. The proliferation of such technologies enabled cash grants to be transformed into collateral for credit and encumbered by debts to private companies. Specialized payment technologies encouraged recipients to accept loans and ensured that they could not default, making cash transfer a site of nearly risk-free profit. My work is informed by over two years of ethnographic fieldwork, hundreds of qualitative interviews, and archival data from the South African Parliament and Constitutional Court. My study finds that while grant payment technologies promise to mitigate the contradictions between providing cash transfers for basic needs and offering profitable financial products, in practice, they can worsen indebtedness. By focusing on the materiality of financial inclusion technologies, I demonstrate how the efficacy of cash transfer programs can be undermined, when debts as well as grants are passed on to recipients."
,,,"Within the areas of distributed, off-grid, and decentralized energy, there is a growing interest in local energy exchanges. A crucial component of an energy exchange is a return provided by an energy-receiver to an energy-giver for the energy provided. The existing energy literature on such returns is primarily limited to monetary returns and lacks a critical discussion on the different types of monetary and non-monetary returns possible and variation in peopleâ€™ preferences for these. Based on an ethnographic â€˜research interventionâ€™ study conducted at two off-grid villages in rural India for 11 months, this article presents a sociocultural understanding of returns. The article presents a classification of returns consisting of three types, i.e., in-cash, in-kind and intangible, and proposes a conceptual model of â€˜returns-continuum.â€™ The article showcases how peopleâ€™s preference for a type of return varies with the nature of their social relationships with each other and suggests that configuring a return is not merely an economic act but a complex sociocultural process. Finally, the article recommends to energy researchers and practitioners to enable diversity in returns, to acknowledge dynamics of social relations in returns, to interconnect energy economy with the local in-kind economy, and to engage with ethnographic approaches."
,,,"While there is a lot of literature from a natural or technical sciences perspective on different forms of digitalization in agriculture (big data, internet of things, augmented reality, robotics, sensors, 3D printing, system integration, ubiquitous connectivity, artificial intelligence, digital twins, and blockchain among others), social science researchers have recently started investigating different aspects of digital agriculture in relation to farm production systems, value chains and food systems. This has led to a burgeoning but scattered social science body of literature. There is hence lack of overview of how this field of study is developing, and what are established, emerging, and new themes and topics. This is where this article aims to make a contribution, beyond introducing this special issue which presents seventeen articles dealing with social, economic and institutional dynamics of precision farming, digital agriculture, smart farming or agriculture 4.0. An exploratory literature review shows that five thematic clusters of extant social science literature on digitalization in agriculture can be identified: 1) Adoption, uses and adaptation of digital technologies on farm; 2) Effects of digitalization on farmer identity, farmer skills, and farm work; 3) Power, ownership, privacy and ethics in digitalizing agricultural production systems and value chains; 4) Digitalization and agricultural knowledge and innovation systems (AKIS); and 5) Economics and management of digitalized agricultural production systems and value chains. The main contributions of the special issue articles are mapped against these thematic clusters, revealing new insights on the link between digital agriculture and farm diversity, new economic, business and institutional arrangements both on-farm, in the value chain and food system, and in the innovation system, and emerging ways to ethically govern digital agriculture. Emerging lines of social science enquiry within these thematic clusters are identified and new lines are suggested to create a future research agenda on digital agriculture, smart farming and agriculture 4.0. Also, four potential new thematic social science clusters are also identified, which so far seem weakly developed: 1) Digital agriculture socio-cyber-physical-ecological systems conceptualizations; 2) Digital agriculture policy processes; 3) Digitally enabled agricultural transition pathways; and 4) Global geography of digital agriculture development. This future research agenda provides ample scope for future interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary science on precision farming, digital agriculture, smart farming and agriculture 4.0."
,,,"This article advances a proposal for conservation basic income (CBI) as a novel strategy for funding biodiversity conservation that moves beyond widely promoted market-based instruments (MBIs). This CBI proposal responds to two important empirical developments. The first concerns growing discussions around cash transfer programs (CTPs) and universal basic income (UBI). These are increasingly implemented or piloted yet do not usually take into account environmental issues including biodiversity conservation. The second relates to MBIs like payments for ecosystem services (PES) and REDD+ (reduced emissions through avoided deforestation and forest degradation). In practice, these programs have not only commonly failed to halt biodiversity loss and alleviate poverty but have also largely abandoned their market-based origins, leading to calls for moving beyond market-based conservation entirely. We conclude that the time is right to integrate and transcend these existing mechanisms to develop conservation basic income as part of a broader paradigm shift towards convivial conservation that foregrounds concerns for social justice and equity."
,,,"The purpose of this paper is to provide a high-level overview of arguments related to â€œfeeding the future.â€ Briefly, this paper opens by exploring the very serious challenge of feeding the world's global population in a way that is sustainable, equitable, nutritious and economically efficient. Part two of this paper presents some of the technological innovations that are proposed as partial solutions to the global food security challenge. The final part of this paper reflects on three specific sociopolitical considerations that must be considered in order to ensure that technological innovation addresses the global food security challenge."
,,,"In this horizon scan, we highlight 15 emerging issues of potential relevance to global conservation in 2020. Seven relate to potentially extensive changes in vegetation or ecological systems. These changes are either relatively new, for example, conversion of kelp forests to simpler macroalgal systems, or may occur in the future, for example, as a result of the derivation of nanocelluose from wood or the rapid expansion of small hydropower schemes. Other topics highlight potential changes in national legislation that may have global effect on international agreements. Our panel of 23 scientists and practitioners selected these issues using a modified version of the Delphi technique from a long-list of 89 potential topics."
,,,"For all the evolutionary ages of mineral resource development, there have not been concerns about sustainable mining until the 21st century. Thus, this paper explores the extent to which emerging geospatial technologies have been deliberately used in the mining industry activities to achieve the United Nations Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. Governments, the mining industry, Non-Governmental and International Organisations have various investments in geospatial programmes and technologies for Environmental and Social Impact Assessments and baseline studies to enhance the achievement of these goals. However, these efforts prove inadequate to link the social, environmental and economic baseline analysis of sustainable development goals. The observations in this paper, therefore, have been obtained largely from extensive literature review to gain a broad understanding of previous and current applications of emerging technologies in the field. The literature has been explored in two successive steps. First, the literature was broadly queried to find the most current works on sustainable mining for three decades (i.e. 1990 to 2019). Second, out of over 100 papers, reports, and books retrieved in the first step, a more specific search and analysis of existing academic and industry literature on the explicit applications of emerging geospatial technology for enhancing sustainable development in the mining sector was conducted. In spite of its ensemble of capabilities for multivariate analysis, analysis of the literature reveals that there is inadequate adaptation of emerging geospatial technologies, which can simultaneously measure and link generally acceptable social, economic and environmental costs and benefits of mining for sustainability considerations in a local setting. There is a dearth of literature that discuss this new approach in addressing sustainable mining. Findings of this paper shall, therefore, inform the scientific community, industry, Non-Governmental Organisations and consultants on emerging approaches to address salient issues of sustainable mining towards meeting the agenda 2030 SDGs."
,,,"The management of energy supply and demand is becoming more challenging, especially in regions where the demand continues to grow rapidly and more intermittent renewable supply sources are added to the energy infrastructure. In this context, Demand Side Management (DSM) can be employed to align supply and demand and improve reliability of the system under supply constraints and stretch the capacity limits of the existing grid infrastructure. A game theoretic approach for a DSM model incorporating storage components is suggested in this paper especially for environments with energy supply constraints. The proposed model is able to not only reduce the Peak-to-Average ratio to benefit the electrical grid, but can also smoothen the dips in the load profile caused by supply constraints. In a case study to demonstrate the value of the model presented, a variety of residential demand types are evaluated within a micro-grid to maximize the payoff utility of both individual users and the whole system. Moreover, emerging blockchain technologies are introduced to guarantee the seamless and secure implementation of the proposed scheme, illustrating how a decentralized demand side management approach could be implemented in practice to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions following optimized demand profiles."
,,,"Flexibility has increasing value across sectors of the economy, including energy. The ability to be flexible is affected by a wide variety of sociotechnical factors and determines what we term â€˜flexibility capitalâ€™. Levels of flexibility capital vary in populations, both absolutely and in the extent to which they are primarily derived from technological or social means, which has implications for the (dis)comfort and (in)convenience involved in economising flexibility capital. Furthermore, we argue that freedom of choice over whether and how to economise flexibility capital can be limited by factors such as financial resources, among others. In constrained systems (such as energy networks), the level of service enjoyed by the more affluent may not simply be higher than those who are less affluent, but may be directly enabled by reductions in the latterâ€™s comfort and/or convenience which may not feel fully voluntary. There is a real risk that such injustices could be locked into energy infrastructure and market design and governance for the long term as has already happened in labour markets. We introduce the concept of â€˜flexibility justiceâ€™ as a frame for these issues of fairness. While the concepts we offer in the paper emerge from longstanding engagements with energy research contexts and they relate directly to the issues currently being debated in the energy research and policy communities, we contend that they can be related to a much broader range of issues in 21st century economies."
,,,"The circular economy is argued to hold great promise for achieving sustainability. Yet, there is a dearth of research about what a circular future may look like. To address this gap, this paper proposes different plausible scenarios for a circular future, using a 2Â Ã—Â 2 scenario matrix method developed through a thought experiment and a focus group. Key drivers of change in this matrix are the nature of technologies deployed â€“ high-tech or low-tech innovations â€“ and the configuration of the governance regime â€“ centralized or decentralized. From this, our paper builds four scenario narratives for the future of a circular economy: â€œplanned circularityâ€, â€œbottom-up sufficiencyâ€, â€œcircular modernismâ€, and â€œpeer-to-peer circularityâ€. It delineates the core characteristics and the upsides and downsides of each scenario. It shows that a circular economy can be organized in very contrasting ways. By generating insights about alternative circular futures, these scenarios may provide a clearer directionality to policy-makers and businesses, helping them both anticipate and understand the consequences of a paradigm shift towards a circular economy and shape policies and strategies, especially in the context of so-called mission-oriented innovation policies. They may also provide a sound basis for quantitatively modelling the impacts of a circular economy."
,,,"Technological development is a longstanding matter of concern in the comprehension of economic growth and wealth. However, a deeper understanding regarding the process of technological catching-up and development of emerging economies is yet to be further gathered. Thus, the aim of this article is to comprehend the path for developing frontier indigenous technologies through technology and knowledge transfer (TKT) and public-private partnerships (PPP). Based on a case-study of technological development in the field of molecular diagnostics in southern Brazil, this article provides a three-stage conical-helix model of technological catching up and development through TKT and PPPs. In the start-up stage, public research actors generate technological capabilities via TKT processes at the local level; in the catching-up stage, frontier technologies are gathered through a new TKT from international actors; in the rising-up stage, frontier technology is developed indigenously and transferred to national and international private industries through PPPs. Therefore, the conical-helix model presented in this study may potentially contribute to the development and implementation of a new generation of public policies for technological development in emerging economies, reducing technological dependence on imported technologies from developed nations."
,,,"In recent years, IoT has developed into many areas of life including smart homes, smart cities, agriculture, offices, and workplaces. Everyday physical items such as lights, locks and industrial machineries can now be part of the IoT ecosystem. IoT has redefined the management of critical and non-critical systems with the aim of making our lives more safe, efficient and comfortable. As a result, IoT technology is having a huge positive impact on our lives. However, in addition to these positives, IoT systems have also attracted negative attention from malicious users who aim to infiltrate weaknesses within IoT systems for their own gain, referred to as cyber security attacks. By creating an introduction to IoT, this paper seeks to highlight IoT cyber security vulnerabilities and mitigation techniques to the reader. The paper is suitable for developers, practitioners, and academics, particularly from fields such as computer networking, information or communication technology or electronics. The paper begins by introducing IoT as the culmination of two hundred years of evolution within communication technologies. Around 2014, IoT reached consumers, early products were mostly small closed IoT networks, followed by large networks such as smart cities, and continuing to evolve into Next Generation Internet; internet systems which incorporate human values. Following this evolutionary introduction, IoT architectures are compared and some of the technologies that are part of each architectural layer are introduced. Security threats within each architectural layer and some mitigation strategies are discussed, finally, the paper concludes with some future developments."
,,,"The Asia-Pacific securities markets are among the fastest growing markets in the world and account for more than one third of the global market capitalization. Drawing from the literature and recent technological developments worldwide, we discuss the current state and the future developments of computerized trading in a set of the largest Asia-Pacific economies, which constitute approximately 85% of the region's securities market. We first identify the drivers and deterrents of computerized trading based on the academic literature and regulatory investigations. We then assess the current viability and the future growth of computerized trading in the Asia-Pacific economies. Finally, we survey the empirical findings on algorithmic and high frequency trading in the Asia-Pacific region in comparison with the global empirical and theoretical literature."
,,,"The challenge of income inequality is widely recognized as the burning issue of our times, and its political consequences are dramatically highlighted recently by Brexit and the victory of Donald Trump in the US election. Depending on how this challenge is understood, however, the solutions could vary dramatically. At one end of the spectrum, the market economy is perceived as having failed to spread equitably the fruits of economic growth, hence more aggressive government interventions, including income redistribution, are needed. At the opposite end, inept governments, counter-productive and anti-market public policies are to be blamed, and it follows that unshackling market forces will lead to improving income equality."
,,,"This chapter discusses the technical considerations for implementing food safety and quality systems in developing countries considering current and future requirements. It will build on initial discussions in Volumes I and II and present more details on requirements for exporting food products into Europe, the United States of America, Canada and Australasia. It will examine the state of food safety within selected countries in the Far East, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Africa and considerations for exporting from these markets into others. Among the issues to be examined are national food laws, regulatory frameworks, compliance and enforcement, national and regional regulatory cooperation and the role of national and regional regulators in facilitating access to export markets and regional trade alliances. The interaction of trade with food safety, nutrition and food security is explored. The chapter provides overviews of the EU and Australia/New Zealand regulatory environment and focused, detailed overviews of key components of the US FDAâ€™s Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) 2011 and the Safe Foods for Canadians Act 2012. Included are explanations of critical components of FSMA and the SFCA, their implications, as well as possible approaches to compliance for food industry and market access practitioners."
,,,"This research explores the effects of adding bitcoin to an optimal portfolio (naÃ¯ve, long-only, semi-constrained with and without bitcoin shorting) by relying on the mean-CVaR approach. We explore bitcoin's role in portfolios of U.S., European and Chinese assets. We back-test to compare the performance of portfolios with and without bitcoin for each scenario. The results show that by adding bitcoin, the portfolio performance improves; but this is due more to the increase in returns than in the reduction of volatility. In addition, the improvement is linked to bitcoin's performance in 2013. We conclude that bitcoin may have a role in portfolio diversification even though our analysis confirms bitcoin speculative characteristics."
,,,"The disruptive innovation theory, proposed and developed by Christensen over 20 years ago, has been widely discussed and applied. However, there are still serious misunderstanding and misusing of the concept and connotation of disruptive innovation. Doubts about its practical significance and predictability also remain. In this paper, we attempt to further clarify the concept and emphasize its important role in guidance in practices through reviewing relevant literatures published in SSCI journals. Furthermore, we propose a multilevel theoretical framework to examine the influence factors of disruptive innovation by integrating various research results. We also provide suggestions and implications for future research."
,,,"This paper examines the co-movements between Bitcoin (BTC) and the Dow Jones World Stock Market Index, regional Islamic stock markets, and Sukuk markets. We apply cross wavelet transform and wavelet coherence analysis with a wavelet-based measure of value at risk. The co-movement is stronger and in the same direction at lower frequencies, suggesting the benefits from diversification with BTC are relatively less for long-term investors compared to short-term investors. Co-movement in the opposite direction at high frequencies implies better benefits of hedging in the short run through diversification in BTC and Islamic equity markets. Robustness tests show that the correlations increase as we increase from an investment horizon of two days to one of 64 days. The frequency-domain causality test shows significant causality flow from BTC to the Islamic market of Asia-Pacific, Japan, and Sukuk markets in the short term. Additionally, BTC is found to lead Asia-Pacific Islamic stock markets in the long term. Finally, we note that the benefits of portfolio diversification with BTC and Islamic assets vary across time and frequencies."
,,,"Non-linearity is characterised by an asymmetric mean-reverting property, which has been found to be inherent in the short-term return dynamics of stocks. In this paper, we explore as to whether cryptocurrency returns, as represented by Bitcoin, exhibit similar asymmetric reverting patterns for minutely, hourly, daily and weekly returns between June 2010 and February 2018. We identify several differences in the behaviour of Bitcoin price returns in the pre- and post-$1000 sub-periods and evidence of asymmetric reverting patterns in the Bitcoin price returns under all the ANAR models employed, regardless of the data frequency considered. We also present evidence indicating stronger reverting behaviour of negative price returns in terms of both reverting speed and magnitude compared to positive returns and evidence of positive serial correlation with prior positive price returns. Finally, we also investigated asymmetries in Bitcoin price return series' persistence by employing higher order ANAR models, finding evidence of a higher persistence of positive returns than negative returns, a result that further supports the existence of asymmetric reverting behaviour in the Bitcoin price returns."

,,,Banking is at an inflection point. Most people think that banking is being reshaped by regulations since the global financial crisis but that is only half the story. The other half is about technology. The multi-trillion-dollar financial services industry is being digitally disrupted and digitally re-imagined. The global financial crisis resulted in a debate on the â€˜too-big-to-failâ€™ banks but it also created a â€˜too-small-to-careâ€™ crisis for small businesses as banks scaled back their lending to the SME sector. Marketplace lending platforms are supporting financial inclusion and providing the much needed access to capital to small businesses that have traditionally been the Goldilocks of digital banking; corporate applications are too complex for them and retail ones are way too simple.
,,,"Measurement, prediction, and modeling of currency price volatility constitutes an important area of research at both the national and corporate level. Countries attempt to understand currency volatility to set national economic policies and firms to best manage exchange rate risk and leverage assets. A relatively new technological invention that the corporate treasurer has to turn to as part of the overall financial strategy is cryptocurrency. One estimate values the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies at $557 billion USD at the beginning of 2018. While the overall size of the market for cryptocurrency is significant, our understanding of the behavior of this instrument is only beginning. In this article, we propose a hybrid Artificial Neural Network-Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ANN-GARCH) model with preprocessing to forecast the price volatility of bitcoin, the most traded and largest by market capitalization of the cryptocurrencies."
,,,"As a result of the increased awareness of the dangers posed by global climate changes (mainly caused by growing global energy consumption needs), the quest for clean and sustainable energy future is becoming of paramount importance. This can be largely realized via a large-scale integration of variable renewable energy sources (RESs) such as wind and solar, which have relatively low carbon footprints. In many power systems, the level of integration of such resources is dramatically increasing. However, their intermittent nature poses significant challenges in the predominantly conventional power systems that currently exist. Among others, frequency and voltage regulation issues can, for example, arise because of improperly balanced and largely uncoordinated RES supply and demand. Generally, the higher the integration level of intermittent power sources is, the higher the flexibility needs are in the system under consideration. Flexibility, in a power systems context, refers to the ability of such a system to effectively cope with unforeseen changes in operational situations, which are mainly induced by the inherent uncertainty and variability arising from the supply side, demand side or any other external factors. In the absence of appropriate flexibility mechanisms, it is increasingly difficult to manage the imbalances between generation and demand as a result of their natural variations in real-time. This paper presents an extensive and critical review of the main existing and emerging flexibility options that can be deployed in power systems to support the integration of â€œcarbon-freeâ€ and variable power production technologies. Starting from a broader definition of flexibility, we highlight the growing importance of such flexibility in renewable-rich energy systems, and provide insights into the challenges and opportunities associated with various flexibility options provided by different technologies."
,,,"Circular Economy (CE) and the adoption of its principles globally are more important than ever to sustain the rate of production of goods and services to meet the ever-increasing consumer demand that is burdening the environment and society. This study investigates the adoption of CE principles amongst emerging economies as the challenges faced by these economies are generally different in terms of resource availability, varying government policies and consumer behaviour from those of developed economies. This research presents an empirically validated CE adoption model using a sample of 183 consumer responses. The study highlights the strong influence of factors such as consumer behaviour on the acceptance of remanufactured products and using products as a service to encourage the adoption of CE practices in emerging economies. This research offers businesses, consumers and policy makers insights into measures that have been taken by emerging economies that are in line with CE principles."
,,,"Never in history have global supply-chain relationships in high-tech electronics firms been more sophisticated, complicated, and almost always tied in some major aspect to China. This research examines how interorganizational (IO) cooperation impacts performance and what role relationship learning and information technology (IT) integration play in the value-creation process for Chinese suppliers in business-to-business (B2B) supply chains. We examine this issue using data collected from face-to-face interviews with supply chain managers and executives from 1,004 Chinese high-tech electronic component suppliers. The results strongly support the hypothesis that IO cooperation improves a supplier's performance regarding both its major customer and overall marketplace. Relationship learning and IT integration are important mediating variables that drive performance. The strongest effect in our study was the influence of IO cooperation on relationship learning. A unique aspect of this study is that it focuses on a large sample of a specific supplier typeâ€”high-tech Chinese suppliers. This, combined with the fact that the sampled companies were involved in manufacturing 13 different product groups, greatly increases the generalizability of the results."
,,,"Financial inclusion is defined as having universal access to reasonably priced financial services, provided by sound and sustainable institutions. It includes saving, investing, borrowing and insurance."
,,,"Over the past few years, cryptocurrencies have increasingly been discussed as alternatives to traditional fiat currencies. These digital currencies have garnered significant interest from investment banks and portfolio managers as a potential option to diversify the financial risk from investing in other assets. This interest has also extended to the general public who have seen cryptocurrencies as a way of making a quick profit. This paper provides a first insight into the applicability of high frequency momentum trading strategies for cryptocurrencies. We implemented two variations of a signal-based momentum trading strategy: (i) a time series method; (ii) a cross sectional method. These strategies were tested on a selection of seven of the largest cryptocurrencies ranked by market capitalization. The results show that there exists potential for the momentum strategy to be used successfully for cryptocurrency trading in a high frequency setting. A comparison with a passive portfolio strategy is proposed, which shows abnormal returns when compared with the momentum strategies. Furthermore, the robustness of our results are checked through the application of the momentum strategies other sample periods. We also compare the performances of the signal-based momentum strategies with returns-based versions of the strategies. It is shown that the signal-based strategy outperforms the returns-based strategy. However, there appears to be no single parameterization of the signal-based strategies that can generate the greatest cumulative return over all sample periods."
,,,"The purpose of this paper is to convey a thorough understanding of the governance-related determinants and financial consequences of carbon performance and disclosure. Its motivation lies in the increasing global political, social, academic as well as practical importance of managing and reporting on carbon-related issues. Methodologically, we employ a systematic literature review. Thus, we identify 73 quantitative peer-reviewed empirical studies in this field and categorize them according to a legitimacy-theory-based framework. Our four main contributions offer new insights into this emerging research field and provide guidance for the development of new research models: First, we help future researchers to structure this emerging field of research with respect to the interactions of the phenomenon itself (carbon performance vs. disclosure), its determinants (country- and firm-related governance), and its financial consequences (value relevance, information asymmetry, financial performance, and cost of capital). Second, we provide a comprehensive overview of variables and proxies used in the studies and list their main statistical effects, which facilitates building novel models. There are indications that 1) board composition positively influences both carbon performance and disclosure, 2) carbon performance and carbon disclosure are positively connected, 3) carbon disclosure reduces information asymmetry, and 4) carbon performance increases financial performance. Third, we develop a research agenda with concise suggestions for future studies. Fourth, we argue that due to the under-theorization of concepts the comparability of included studies is challenging, this research field may be characterized as a vibrant field for extensive future research."
,,,"Multi-sided platforms, enabling interactions between different user sides, hold an important place in the contemporary economy. Current literature, focusing on established and successful platforms, has neglected to study B2B multi-sided platform adoption mechanisms. In this article, we analyze these mechanisms by investigating the case of dematerialization platforms for B2B transactions between the multiple actors involved in public works contracts. Various qualitative materials, including 28 semi-structured interviews, were gathered over a thirty-month period. Adopting a business user perspective, this study contributes to the literature on multi-sided platforms in various ways. We show that platform adoption, in project-based B2B contexts, is mainly constrained by a high level of affiliation costs and the existence of tight-interdependencies between users' activities at project level. Thus, a consecutive adoption path would result in negative cross-group network externalities and undermine the platform's attractiveness. Conversely, a concurrent adoption path would activate positive network externalities and encourage platform adoption decisions."
,,,"Since the inception of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Next 11 (N11) countries are facing difficulties in attaining the SDG objectives, as maintaining the environmental quality has been a challenge for them. In this study, we have revisited the technology policies of these countries, and in doing so, we have tried to address the problem of environmental degradation, while addressing the issues of sustained economic growth, clean and affordable energy, and quality education. In this pursuit, we have designed two indices for environmental degradation and technological advancement, and then analyzed the association between them following the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. The empirical analysis has been done by IPAT framework, and by using bootstrapped quantile regression and rolling window heterogeneous panel casualty tests, over a period of 1990â€“2017. Following the results obtained from the analysis, we have tried to address the objectives of SDG 13, SDG 4, SDG 8, SDG 9, SDG 7, and SDG 10."
,,,"This paper discusses the potential and constraints for using broadband channels and applications to increase financial inclusion. We consider ten different opportunity areas, and each is described with reference to an illustrative prototypical example. The paper draws on experiences in Latin America, though the main themes and lessons are likely to be applicable more broadly."
,,,"This paper presents a case study on JD.com, one of the largest e-commerce platforms in China, to demonstrate how this online retailer enhances its competitive advantage by employing supply chain finance (SCF) practices to accelerate collaboration within the supply chain. Based on field interviews, this study investigates motivations and enabling factors for SCF adoption. Results show that JD adopts SCF mainly to strengthen its ecosystem and attain competitive advantage. In the sight of resource-based view and dynamic capability, JD builds an iterative process to conduct SCF practice. Enabling factors, mainly financial technology (fintech) and bargaining power, play critical roles in the decision-making process. The development of fintech facilitates the digitalization and capitalization process by improving transparency and efficiency while bargaining power influences the productization process. The adoption of SCF practice helps JD build closer partnership with supply chain partners and improves its own competitive advantage."
,,,"Origin decisions related to the manufacture of limited-edition luxury goods can be critical for luxury brands, because consumers often have strong origin preferences. We hence study two competing luxury brandsâ€™ production outsourcing decisions by incorporating tradeoffs among competition intensity, origin preferences, and quantity limits. Interestingly, we find that when luxury brands have the option, they tend to outsource production to an overseas contract manufacturer even when origin preferences for overseas goods are not strong and the downstream competition is mild. Correspondingly, if a brandâ€™s rival has no outsourcing options, its profit might be hurt when origin preferences for overseas goods and competition intensity are both moderate."
,,,"Today, firms encounter scarce resources and rapid technology change which render formerly successful business models obsolete. Research shows that some firms perform better than others in continuously discovering, evaluating, and exploiting opportunities in volatile environments and that this is dependent on firmâ€™s dynamic capabilities. Besides obtaining dynamic capabilities through internal R&D activities, firms have open up their innovation process to pursue dynamic capabilities outside their organizational boundaries through external corporate venturing by accessing startup's technological capabilities necessary to innovate. External corporate venturing is a means to develop new distinctive capabilities and businesses by exploring and exploiting business opportunities outside a firmâ€™s existing boundaries. Drawing on the dynamic capability literature, we use a multiple case study approach to examine the contribution of external corporate venturing to firmsâ€™ dynamic capabilities. Our results reveal that firms indeed use corporate venturing to identify and exploit startupâ€™s technological knowledge and competencies to increase firmâ€™s dynamic capabilities. But our empirical data also shows that not every firm is fully profiting from all dynamic capability phases as their corporate venturing modes are not linked with each other and cumulative effects are not realized."
,,,"This chapter examines the relationships between information and communication technologies and various aspects of financial development in Europe. After the presentation of the variables, a purely empirical analysis is conducted. The second part of the chapter considers the impact of ICT on the financial system at large and on particular segments, such as banking. The third and fourth parts of the chapter examine the role of ICT in the evolution of financial markets, especially stock markets. Finally, we set out data on the linkage between ICT and financial innovation, using the example of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The period covered is 1990â€“2016. The main research methods used here include country-level development trajectories, local polynomial regressions, and panel models."
,,,"Present day consumers are accustomed to the fast and ubiquitous access to information and services brought about by digitalization. In contrast, electronic payments between bank accounts, even within the same country, can often take more than a day to complete. The reality is that interbank payment systems are a well-entrenched infrastructure and have taken a long time to evolve and mature to its present state. They were originally designed decades ago for specific purpose, at a time that pre-dates mobile technologies. There are limitations to how effectively they can handle present day payment scenarios, even after iterations of costly enhancements and retrofitting. As such, this gives rise to a sudden increase in implementations of interbank real-time retail payment systems over the last decade. These payment systems are not new in concept but are new in scope. They can process account-to-account fund transfers faster than traditional ACH networks, be more scalable than wholesale payment systems, cheaper than card payments and more ubiquitous than closed loop services. However, the implementations of such systems can come at greater complexities and costs especially to the banks. The purpose of this writing is to help the reader gain an insight into how real-time payment systems fit within the interbank retail payment landscape as well as the complexities and challenges in their implementations and design."
,,,"Supply chain finance (SCF) aims to optimally align financial resource flows with material and information flows within supply chains. Although an increasing number of studies have demonstrated the potential of SCF resulting in improving cash-flow management and obtaining loan opportunities for suppliers and buyers, little is known about whether SCF initiatives can result in positive market value for service providers. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to examine the effect of SCF initiatives with the distinctive characteristics (that is, firm characteristic, collaborative mechanism, and service type) on service providersâ€™ market value. We adopted the event study methodology to analyse 177 SCF initiatives announced between 2008 and 2018 (Quarter 1) in the Chinese market. The event study results showed that the average abnormal returns over a three-day event window around the SCF announcements are 0.793%, representing an average increase of CNY 1.66 billion in market value for the service providers. Moreover, we found that such increase in market value is significantly higher when the SCF initiatives are announced by non-bank investors (e.g., fintechs), when the service providers collaborate to provide SCF services, and when the service providers upgrade existing SCF services rather than introduce new SCF services. As the market value of an SCF announcement is evaluated with several essential characteristics examined to understand which types of service providers and initiatives are considered to be the most valuable service offerings, this study offers important insights to SCF practitioners and supply chain stakeholders."
,,,"The bitcoin blockchain provides the new ability to securely transact in the transfer of value or data without intermediaries, and is indispensible when the distribution of influence is valuable or preferred over centralized operations. With blockchain technology, the ledger necessary to verify and record identity and asset ownership for transactional access - once the purview of trusted central institutions (development banks, Bretton Woods Institutions, large-scale investment firms, etc.) - is free from the limitations imposed by centralized controls. While a number of old needs now served by these institutions will become obsolete, new blockchain-enabled institutional mechanisms will address a variety of remaining needs more efficiently. New needs will also emerge to be addressed by old, new, and blockchain-refined institutional mechanisms. A continuous iterative process is imperative during such periods of rapid change. Global financial institutions must be responsive to the cultural shift and dynamic societal values accompanying blockchain innovation."
,,,"This chapter describes how mobile technologies are expanding digital financial inclusion, defined as providing access and delivery of basic banking services, savings, lending, insurance and other financial services to everyone in the populationâ€”especially those who live under the poverty line. The World Bank estimates that over 38 percent of adults in the world, or about two billion adults are unbanked, having no access to formal banking services. Financial inclusion helps those unbanked and underbanked bridge the gaps between the physical, digital and psychological use and access to money. In today's digital world, physical cash is rapidly becoming a remnant of traditional societal mores and legacy financial systems that have disadvantaged the unbanked. By combining digital financial tools (such as mobile remittances using blockchain technology) with psychological tools (such as financial education), the unbanked can attain financial services and break out of the poverty cycle."
,,,"The landscape of financial inclusion has for long been considered as the soft side of financial services, having received scarce attention from a financial, regulatory, and policy point of view, despite its central role within the global economic empowerment. Part of the disadvantaged and low-income segments of global population is left without (i.e. financially excluded) or very limited access (i.e. financially underserved) to basic financial services, creating a highly critical equality deficit in different parts of the world. In this frame of reference, financial exclusion still remains a highly critical problem that hinders developing regions around the world from eradicating poverty leading to large-scale starvation and civil unrest. Moreover, financial exclusion is interwoven with social dependency making financially excluded/underserved populations strongly dependable on their social networks. The emergence of FinTech, the new breed between financial innovation and financial technology, which has been challenging the prevailing position of incumbent financial institutions, is providing a promising vehicle of tackling this phenomenon by closing the gap between unbanked, under-banked and developed societies, opening the door to the global digital economy, bringing a long-term societal transformational change for the financially excluded/underserved, while leading to inclusive economic growth helping move towards a more just and equitable society."
,,,"The transformation of empirical research due to the arrival of big data analytics and data science, as well as the new availability of methods that emphasize causal inference, are moving forward at full speed. In this Research Commentary, we examine the extent to which this has the potential to influence how e-commerce research is conducted. China offers the ultimate in data-at-scale settings, and the construction of real-world natural experiments. Chinese e-commerce includes some of the largest firms involved in e-commerce, mobile commerce, social media and social networks. This article was written to encourage young faculty and doctoral students to engage in research that can be carried out in near real-time, with truly experimental or quasi-experimental research designs, and with the clear intention of establishing causal inferences that relate the precursors and drivers of observable outcomes through various kinds of processes. We discuss: the relevant data sources and research contexts; the methods perspectives that are appropriate which blend Computer Science, Statistics and Econometrics, how the research can be made relevant for China; and what kinds of findings and research directions are available. This article is not a tutorial on big data analytics methods in general though, nor does it cover just those published works that demonstrate big data methods and empirical causality in other disciplines. Instead, the empirical research covered is mostly taken from Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, which has published many articles on Chinese e-commerce. This Research Commentary invites researchers in China and the Asia Pacific region to expand their coverage to bring into their empirical work the new methods and philosophy of causal data science."
,,,"Bitcoins have become a fad among investors despite of the ambiguity surrounding on its nature and characteristics. This study aims to contribute to the existing literature of examining bitcoin returns under a financial asset purview. Through multiple robust tests, the market efficiency of daily bitcoin returns is analyzed for the time frame of July 2010 till March 2018. Strong evidence of market inefficiency characterized by absence of random walk model is found. The market inefficiency was found attributable to the presence of asymmetric volatility clustering. More studies are needed to examine the temporal dynamics of bitcoin returns."
,,,"Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have fascinated technologists and investors alike. They have become prevalent, with over 2,000 Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies now in use. Most jurisdictions have not regulated cryptocurrencies. Whether existing regulations apply to cryptocurrency turns ultimately on if we classify cryptocurrencies as currencies, securities, or derivatives, or a money services (transfer) vehicle. In this set of exploratory analyses we seek to classify Bitcoin. We utilize a variety of methods to compare aspects of its behavior to: currencies, asset classes such as derivatives, technology-based products and possible technology-based products such as Ether and the security SPY, and speculative financial bubbles. We find that Bitcoin's behavior more closely resembles a technology-based product, an emerging asset class, or a bubble event, rather than a currency or a security; such that it is correct that existing currency and security laws should not apply to cryptocurrencies."
,,,"This study applies a set of measures developed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012, 2016) to examine connectedness via return and volatility spillovers across six large cryptocurrencies from August 7, 2015 to February 22, 2018. Regardless of the sign of returns, the results show that Litecoin and Bitcoin are at the centre of the connected network of returns. This finding implies that return shocks arising from these two cryptocurrencies have the most effect on other cryptocurrencies. Further analysis shows that connectedness via negative returns is largely stronger than via positive ones. Ripple and Ethereum are the top recipients of negative-return shocks, whereas Ethereum and Dash exhibit very weak connectedness via positive returns. Regarding volatility spillovers, Bitcoin is the most influential, followed by Litecoin; Dash exhibits a very weak connectedness, suggesting its utility for hedging and diversification opportunities in the cryptocurrency market. Taken together, results imply that the importance of each cryptocurrency in return and volatility connectedness is not necessarily related to its market size. Further analyses reveal that trading volume and global financial and uncertainty effects as well as the investment-substitution effect are determinants of net directional spillovers. Interestingly, higher gold prices and US uncertainty increase the net directional negative-return spillovers, whereas they do the opposite for net directional positive-return spillovers. Furthermore, gold prices exhibit a negative sign for net directional-volatility spillovers, whereas US uncertainty shows a positive sign. Economic actors interested in the cryptocurrency market can build on our findings when weighing their decisions."
,,,"Bitcoin is the digital currency of the digital economy. This article is an attempt to reveal the effects of policy uncertainty on Bitcoin returns with economic policy uncertainty (EPU) in the US, the UK, Japan, China, and Hong Kong. Furthermore, we also present the results of monetary policy uncertainty (MPU) on the Bitcoin market. The robust estimations from the quantile regression and Markov regime-switching model show that Bitcoin returns are affected by EPU. One of the essential findings is that Bitcoin returns are more responsive to EPU in the US, China, and Japan. In the US and Japan, uncertainty has a negative effect on the Bitcoin market whereas in China it has a positive effect. Global MPU uncertainty is also significant in explaining Bitcoin exchange rates. Moreover, the Bitcoin market is negatively affected by uncertainty in Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the gross domestic product, and other macroeconomic data. Uncertainty in the equity market and Bitcoin returns are negatively associated."
,,,"Prior to the advent of large interconnected energy systems, community power needs were typically met through the use of small municipal power stations. As networks expanded and large-scale generation became an affordable alternative, the energy needs of most urban populations were largely serviced by centralized, fossil fuel based generation and transmission infrastructure. However, in the past decade, due to the advent of affordable solar and storage technology, this is transitioning to a hybrid model including distributed renewable energy and storage. While many households presently benefit from embedded solar photovoltaic systems, in high-density areas such as cities, this technology is difficult to provide, due to how the multitenanted buildings are governed. Demand for shared energy solutions within communities has seen the emergence of community-owned renewable energy and storage solutions. How these are being deployed depends on the policies that enable them, as well as by new commercial and governance models. This chapter examines commercial and governance models for multitenanted buildings and community owned renewable energy and storage to demonstrate how planning can best be optimized and result in the emergence of citizen utilities."
,,,"In the modern business environment, consumers are increasingly influenced by megatrends involving marketplace, technology, socioeconomics, geopolitics, and natural environment. Simultaneously, the data and insights that can inform consumer attitudes and behaviors often reside outside of firms' direct control. Consciously incorporating these interdependent factors into firms' decision-making is essential for adaptability and sustainable profitability. Building on the â€œoutside-inâ€ perspective, we propose that firm strategies should be informed through the lens of the marketing ecosystem that considers the interrelated and dynamic megatrends. By leveraging advances in data and technology, firms can sense-make the marketplace by extracting insights from massive amounts of diverse consumer data with modern-day analytics. By mapping out the megatrends with marketing analytics, firms can 1) more accurately predict consumers' changing preferences and formulate appropriate strategies to engage with them; and 2) become more market-adaptable and competitive in the present and the future. To deliver sustainably compelling value to customers, firms should adopt an ecosystem mindset and cooperate with various stakeholders. A broad-thinking, agile, and humble firm culture can enable the development of more robust outside-in capabilities. We elaborate on the megatrends in the interconnected world of the marketing ecosystem, and propose emerging research directions in each area."
,,,"In this concept paper, we will address several critical questions: how can we enhance smart use of precious resources, support environmental sustainability and assist the developing world in their growth process? We put forward a policy framework that can potentially address these three questions and in addition could represent a critical step towards a circular economy eliminating the need for a post-resource discussion. Using precious metals as an example, we present a novel concept that combines policy, business and technological aspects aimed at making efficient use of finite resources and distributing the revenue more evenly. This approach could hence create jobs and eliminate the need of a post-resource discussion for post-industrial economies. Moreover, we will illustrate herein how this approach could be the initial step of the leapfrogging to a post-resource economy with maximized employment. Furthermore, the advance of some emerging technologies, such as block chain and associated smart contracts could be leveraged to track the primary asset being leased. We also note the broader impact on sustainability and economics with the implications of such a model in driving a circular economy, encouraging GDP growth, addressing resource â€œscarcityâ€ and on the environment."
,,,"The blockchain has received significant attention from technology focussed researchers, highlighting its perceived impact and emerging disruption potential, but has been slow to engender any significant momentum within the Information Systems (IS) and Information Management (IM) literature. This study approaches the subject through an IS/IM lens developing the key themes from the blockchain based research via a comprehensive review. This analysis of the body of literature highlights that although few commercial grade blockchain applications currently exist, the technology demonstrates significant potential to benefit a number of industry wide use cases. This study expands on this point articulating through each of the key themes to develop a detailed narrative on the numerous potential blockchain applications and future direction of the technology, whilst discussing the many barriers to adoption. The study asserts that blockchain technology has the potential to contribute to a number of the UN Sustainability Development Goals and engender widespread change within a number of established industries and practices."
,,,"This chapter will investigate how the transformation of the airline distribution ecosystem, fuelled by changes in the socioeconomic and demographic area, technology, disintermediation, GDS and online travel agency developments, mobile distribution channels and emerging disruptors, are affecting the tourists that are travelling by air. Related concepts such as fare merchandising, ancillaries, and personalisation, as well as the growing importance of big data, IATA NDC, and artificial intelligence, will be explored."
,,,"Until recently, technology has been considered an enabler for improvements in underlying supply chain and logistics operations. However, recent trends in society and business, such as mobile computing, social media, and online retailing, have significantly changed almost every aspect of the supply chain and logistics landscape.

,,,"Cryptocurrency is a relatively new combination of cryptology and currency in financial areas and is increasingly frequently used worldwide. Blockchain applications are expected to reshape the renewable energy market. However, there is a lack of studies covering the power usage of digital currencies. Therefore, this study ran experiments on mining efficiency of nine kinds of cryptocurrencies and ten algorithms. A comparison of statistical analysis of data in a benchmark and experiment results of Monero mining was conducted. Thereafter, this study provided an estimation of global electricity consumption of the Monero mining activity. The results indicated that the hashing algorithm mainly determines the mining efficiency. Data analysis and experiments and estimated Monero mining electricity consumption in the world and its carbon emission in China as a case study. In 2018, Monero mining may consume 645.62â€¯GWh of electricity in the world after its hard fork. The Monero mining in China may consume 30.34â€¯GWh and contribute a carbon emission of 19.12â€“19.42 thousand tons from April to December in 2018. Although cryptocurrency mining and blockchain technology are promising, their influence on energy conversation and sustainable development should be further studied."

,,,"In times of rising organic food popularity, both producers and retailers are faced with the question of how to appropriately price their products. In this paper, we discuss the drivers that influence consumer willingness to pay (WTP) for organic food based on a systematic review of the literature in this field over the past two decades (1999â€“2019). Based on the identified sources, we cluster these WTP drivers into three categories: consumer-related, product-related, and purchasing venue-related factors. Additionally, we review and discuss the methodologies employed in eliciting WTP for organic food. Finally, we attempt to outline potential areas for future research as well as managerial implications."
,,,"Inspired by the insurgence of the decade-old cryptocurrency market and its gradual acceptance into mainstream finance, this paper examines the evolving dynamic characteristics of the new currencies, in the midst of diverse emerging assets of the BRICS. We test for chaos in the time and scale return samples using LLE estimations. Our results accept (reject) chaotic structure for almost all the markets at the weekly (full and intraweek) data samples, and further found no copious disparity amongst the dynamic structure of the markets, contrary to the widely reported weak connectedness and somehow isolated cryptocurrencies from other financial assets. The findings hold implications for asset return forecasting, investment risk and regulatory policy."
,,,"The purpose of the paper is to provide a historical evolution of data driven marketing and suggest next frontiers of research opportunities as a consequence of digital tsunami as well as affordability and accessibility to conduct databased research. Earlier, techniques were in search of data but in the future data will be in search of techniques, especially in the era of social media such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Whatâ€™s App, and Instagram."
,,,"This study addresses the effects of the firmâ€™s level of engagement with trade associations located at the companyâ€™s export market on export performance. It analyzes firm-level data from a South American emerging economy, Chile. Results show that a stronger engagement with trade associations located at the companyâ€™s export market has a positive effect on export performance. Environmental uncertainty on customer needs is confirmed as an export performance barrier, but unexpectedly, this obstacle only diminishes in a negligible factor as the level of engagement with trade associations located at the firmâ€™s export market increases. This study contributes to the international management literature by investigating the direct and moderating effects of overseas trade associations on the firmâ€™s export performance, and by scrutinizing on the distinctions among the cooperation determinants of local networks and networks situated at the firmâ€™s export market. Practical implications are discussed."
,,,"This chapter unveils the global problem of water scarcity and demonstrates how a sustainable future can be secured for our global water assets by combining Blockchain technology with green finance. It gives readers another perspective on sustainable strategy and how to turn a profit from securing the future of our natural resources, using an integrative approach, systems thinking and principles of the circular economy. A full discussion is included to show the advantages of green economics and Blockchain and their possible integration. An introduction of water credits and water trading on Blockchain concepts provide an example of integrative solutions aimed at addressing the water sustainability problem, using innovative thinking and a partnership approach."
,,,"Edge computing is radically shaping the way Internet services are run by enabling computations to be available close to the users - thus mitigating the latency and performance challenges faced in todayâ€™s Internet infrastructure. Emerging markets, rural and remote communities are further away from the cloud and edge computing has indeed become an essential panacea. Many solutions have been recently proposed to facilitate efficient service delivery in edge data centers. However, we argue that those solutions cannot fully support the operations in Community Mesh Networks (CMNs) since the network connection may be less reliable and exhibit variable performance. In this paper, we propose to leverage lightweight virtualisation, Information-Centric Networking (ICN), and service deployment algorithms to overcome these limitations. The proposal is implemented in the PiCasso system, which utilises in-network caching and name based routing of ICN, combined with our HANET (HArdware and NETwork Resources) service deployment heuristic, to optimise the forwarding path of service delivery in a network zone. We analyse the data collected from the Guifi.net Sants network zone, to develop a smart heuristic for the service deployment in that zone. Through a real deployment in Guifi.net, we show that HANET improves the response time up to 53% and 28.7% for stateless and stateful services respectively. PiCasso achieves 43% traffic reduction on service delivery in our real deployment, compared to the traditional host-centric communication. The overall effect of our ICN platform is that most content and service delivery requests can be satisfied very close to the client device, many times just one hop away, decoupling QoS from intra-network traffic and origin server load."
,,,"The economic development of rural India requires connecting remote villages to local and global supply chains. Yet, high rates of financial exclusion inhibit rural Indians from participating in these supply networks. We review the literature on financial inclusion, adoption, and blockchain in India, and posit that to resolve financial exclusion, the four challenges of geographical access, high cost, inappropriate banking products, and financial illiteracy need to be overcome. Next, we argue that blockchain technologies hold the potential to overcome most of these challenges. However, for blockchain technologies to become the cornerstone of financial inclusion initiatives, an understanding of technology adoption in India is needed. To guide the development of such understanding, we develop a research agenda on the antecedents of adoption, adoption patterns, and outcomes of adoption. Answering these research questions will lead to a nuanced understanding of adoption of blockchain-based technologies in rural India. The practical contribution of this paper is the discussion of how blockchain can alleviate the issue of financial exclusion in rural India, thereby providing a basis for a solution that could connect rural Indians to global supply chain networks. The theoretical contribution lies in the identification of knowledge gaps that should be answered to achieve financial inclusion of rural Indians."
,,,"An initial coin offering (ICO) is an innovative way for entrepreneurs of blockchain companies to raise capital by selling tokens to a crowd of investors. Regardless of its popularity, ICO is still considered as a controversial activity that has emerged in the domain of financial technology (fintech). However, even though ICOs have attracted much attention in the cryptocurrency market, research in this area is still sparse. In this article, we comment on recent work discussing information asymmetry in ICOs. We explore the significance of the research in the fintech domain. We also point out interesting research questions in this area that are worthy of investigation and some directions for future research."
,,,"This chapter surveys the landscape of insurance technology and its potential from the perspective of enablement for financial and insurance services. Digital revolution is occurring in a sector that has hardly changed over the last 300 years. Surprising to many, recent innovation in China's digital finance space has shown that emerging entities can and will disrupt the multitrillion-dollar industry. With big data and Blockchain, the impact on insurance sector is going to be a lot faster and more significant than most people will anticipate."
,,,"Over the past more than four decades, several theoretical models have been developed to understand the acceptance and use of information systems. Realising the dilemma in selecting the appropriate theoretical model to assess the acceptance and use of technology and considering the pattern of using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), a modified version (meta-UTAUT) has been developed based on the synthesis of results from 162 existing studies. The aim of this article is to review the emerging literature on meta-UTAUT and offer some future research recommendations. The analysis suggests that studies have started citing the relationships suggested by meta-UTAUT and researchers have reviewed it alongside other alternative models while analysing acceptance and use of technology."
,,,"As the Sharing Economy is emboldened by bitcoin and blockchain network peer-to-peer transaction processing, the virtuous cycle of efficiency of the Sharing Economy will be strengthened. The waste of fallow assets is reduced, and the related need for individual resource ownership declines. This increases the amount of discretionary budget and time available to consumers, and these newly available capital and time supplies may be applied to innovation, leisure, or other pursuits. As Bitcoin opens access to the global village of Internet-enabled commerce and collaborative consumption-based marketplaces, the noted impact multiplies. When the Sharing Economy at scale adapts to process transactions on the blockchain, the value of bitcoin and the blockchain is increased, and the adoption of Bitcoin grows. This further opens access to the Internet marketplace and to peer-to-peer transactions and sharing. Popular culture moves away from dependence on asset ownership and from the use of ownership to define self-identity."
,,,"This study utilizes both a resource-based view and organizational learning theory to present the need to distinguish information sharing from information usage. Our main research aim was to investigate the mediating role of information usage between information sharing, and operational efficiency and effectiveness. We tested the hypotheses in our relational model using empirical data obtained from food retailers in Turkey. The analysis of results from structural equation modeling reveal that the separation of information sharing from information usage is valid, and the mediating role of usage is significant in improving operational effectiveness and efficiency. We further utilized a Bayesian neural networks-based causal analytic model, i.e., universal structure modeling methodology to reveal non-trivial, implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful relationships among the constructs."
,,,"In emerging markets, there are data quality problems. In this paper, we establish theoretical models to explore how data quality problems affect sustainable fashion supply chain operations. We start with the decentralized supply chain and find that poor data quality lowers supply chain profit and social welfare. We consider the implementation of blockchain to help and identify the situation in which blockchain helps enhance social welfare but brings harm to supply chain profitability. We propose a government sponsor scheme as well as an environment taxation waiving scheme to help. We further extend the study to the centralized supply chain setting."
,,,"This paper explores the role of Bitcoin in diversifying investment risks during periods of high global economic policy uncertainty. It employs the bootstrap full- and sub-sample rolling-window Granger causality tests to investigate the mutual causal influence between global economic policy uncertainty and Bitcoin returns. It finds that global economic policy uncertainty has both positive and negative causal impacts on Bitcoin returns, suggesting that Bitcoin cannot always be viewed as a new basket for eggs since it can not always be considered to hedge policy uncertainty. The paper finds a positive reverse causal impact of Bitcoin returns on global economic policy uncertainty, indicating that the Bitcoin market contains useful information to forecast global economic policy uncertainty. Additional analyses suggest that global economic policy uncertainty also contains valuable information to improve the prediction of returns and volatility in the Bitcoin market. Under the recent global trade tensions and complex economic environment, these analyses imply that investors and countries can exploit the Bitcoin market to optimize their investment."
,,,"The paper investigates the proprieties of Bitcoin in the financial markets. Specifically, we explore the conditional cross effects and volatility spillover between Bitcoin and financial indicators using different multivariate GARCH specifications. The nature of interaction between Bitcoin and financial variables and their transmission mechanisms are taken into account when analyzing the diversification and hedging effectiveness across gold asset and stock market. Our findings suggest that all models confirm the significant returns and volatility spillovers. More importantly, we find that VARMA (1,1)-DCC-GJR-GARCH is the best-fit model for modeling the joint dynamics of a variety of financial assets. We also show that a short position in the Bitcoin market allows hedging the risk investment for all different financial assets. Finally, hedging strategies involving gold, oil, equities and Bitcoin reduce considerably the portfolio's risk, as compared to the risk of the portfolio made up of gold, oil and equities only."
,,,"We study the asymmetric multifractality between five main cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ripple, Monero, and Dash) and six equity ETFs from February 2, 2015 to April 30, 2019. The equity ETFs selected relate to emerging markets, China, Japan, the energy sector, financial sector, and technologyâ€“Nasdaq. Results from the multifractal asymmetric detrended cross-correlation analysis show a significant persistence and evidence of asymmetric multifractality in the cross-correlation between most of the pairs of cryptocurrencies and ETFs. These findings, which are consistent with previous findings on the susceptibility of Bitcoin to multifractality, indicate the presence of heterogeneity in the cross-relationship between most cryptocurrencies and equity ETFs."
,,,"As far back as the industrial revolution, significant development in technical innovation has succeeded in transforming numerous manual tasks and processes that had been in existence for decades where humans had reached the limits of physical capacity. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers this same transformative potential for the augmentation and potential replacement of human tasks and activities within a wide range of industrial, intellectual and social applications. The pace of change for this new AI technological age is staggering, with new breakthroughs in algorithmic machine learning and autonomous decision-making, engendering new opportunities for continued innovation. The impact of AI could be significant, with industries ranging from: finance, healthcare, manufacturing, retail, supply chain, logistics and utilities, all potentially disrupted by the onset of AI technologies. The study brings together the collective insight from a number of leading expert contributors to highlight the significant opportunities, realistic assessment of impact, challenges and potential research agenda posed by the rapid emergence of AI within a number of domains: business and management, government, public sector, and science and technology. This research offers significant and timely insight to AI technology and its impact on the future of industry and society in general, whilst recognising the societal and industrial influence on pace and direction of AI development."
,,,"This chapter considers the evolution of alternative digital currencies from DigiCash to Bitcoin, the very digital currency that has spurred the development of this book. Specifically, this chapter explores the general features of Bitcoin and its benefits and risks before suggesting some conditions for a successful cryptocurrency to thrive. The chapter then concludes with optimism about the future of cryptocurrency and its underlying technology."
,,,"We empirically identify carry trade activities under the disguise of bitcoin transactions on USD and CNY bitcoin exchanges during the post global financial crisis period. Relying on variations of bitcoin exchange pairs and two policy shocks, we find the evidence of inflow capital control evasion. We show that the relative CNY to USD bitcoin price, indicating capital inflow volume, of those with high excessive currency conversion profit respond significantly more negatively to carry trade returns. Moreover, this relationship becomes significantly weaker when China tightens its regulations on bitcoin transactions."
,,,"Utilizing the empirical data of ten major cryptocurrencies, this article examines the investablitiy and role of diversification in cryptocurrency market, and evaluates the out-of-sample performance of commonly used asset allocation models across cryptocurrencies. We show that portfolio diversification across different cryptocurrencies can significantly improve the investment results. We also find robust evidence that the maximum utility model dominates the out-of-sample utility, although none of the models can consistently beat the naÃ¯ve 1/N portfolio in Sharpe ratio."
,,,"In light of the concerted efforts to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) per the so-called Paris Agreement, the Information and Communication Industry (ICT) has received little attention as a significant contributor to GHGE and if anything is often highly praised for enabling efficiencies that help reduce other industry sectors footprint. In this paper, we aim at assessing the global carbon footprint of the overall ICT industry, including the contribution from the main consumer devices, the data centers and communication networks, and compare it with the to the total worldwide GHGE. We conduct a detailed and rigorous analysis of the ICT global carbon footprint, including both the production and the operational energy of ICT devices, as well as the operational energy for the supporting ICT infrastructure. We then compare this contribution to the global 2016-level GHGE. We have found that, if unchecked, ICT GHGE relative contribution could grow from roughly 1â€“1.6% in 2007 to exceed 14% of the 2016-level worldwide GHGE by 2040, accounting for more than half of the current relative contribution of the whole transportation sector. Our study also highlights the contribution of smart phones and shows that by 2020, the footprint of smart phones alone would surpass the individual contribution of desktops, laptops and displays. Finally, we offer some actionable recommendations on how to mitigate and curb the ICT explosive GHGE footprint, through a combination of renewable energy use, tax policies, managerial actions and alternative business models."
,,,"Industry 4.0 is expected to impart profound changes to the configuration of manufacturing companies with regards to what their value proposition will be and how their production network, supplier base and customer interfaces will develop. The literature on the topic is still fragmented; the features of the emerging paradigm appear to be a contested territory among different academic disciplines. This study assumes a value chain perspective to analyze the evolutionary trajectories of manufacturing companies. We developed a Delphi-based scenario analysis involving 76 experts from academia and practice. The results highlight the most common expectations as well as controversial issues in terms of emerging business models, size, barriers to entry, vertical integration, rent distribution, and geographical location of activities. Eight scenarios provide a concise outlook on the range of possible futures. These scenarios are based on four main drivers which stem from the expertsâ€™ comments: demand characteristics, transparency of data among value chain participants, maturity of additive manufacturing and advanced robotics, and penetration of smart products. Researchers can derive from our study a series of hypotheses and opportunities for future research on Industry 4.0. Managers and policymakers can leverage the scenarios in long-term strategic planning."
,,,"The coronavirus pandemic is having a clear impact on the supply chains of virtually all manufacturers, retailers, and wholesalers. As the world attempts to navigate through this difficult time, most companies are struggling to maintain a steady flow of required goods and services. Whether it is frozen foods and grocery items (i.e., toilet papers), or ventilators and masks, or even the services (i.e., clinic visits), the supply chain has been facing multiple obstacles. Most models and frameworks built in the extant literature are not been able to capture these disruptions and as such, firms are not having proper strategies to deal with. For firms with complex supply chains (i.e., manufacturing, retailing), it is indeed critical to identify strategies to deal with such a crisis. In this paper, we intend to offer strategic insights in terms of major issues firms are facing and strategic options firms are contemplating. We rely on the twitter data for NASDAQ 100 firms to generate themes regarding the issues faced by the firms and the strategies they are adopting using text analytics tools. We find that firms are facing challenges in terms of demand-supply mismatch, technology, development of a resilient supply chain. Moreover, moving beyond profitability, firms are experiencing difficulties to construct a sustainable supply chain. We provide futuristic strategic recommendations for the rebuilding of the supply chain."
,,,"This study examines the link between returns and volatility of Bitcoin, at both contemporaneous and intertemporal levels, employing high-frequency data. The intraday price variability is proxied by four different measures, namely realized variance, jump variation, downside realized semivariance, and negative signed jump variation. The empirical analysis suggests that all realized volatility proxies have a significant and negative contemporaneous relation with Bitcoin returns. On the other hand, there is weak evidence of a negative intertemporal relation between returns and realized variance, jump variation, and downside realized semivariance. Accordingly, the existence of a positive risk-return trade-off in Bitcoin markets seems to be unsubstantiated. The findings are robust, even after controlling for a number of relevant determinants of the price formation process of Bitcoin."
,,,"Business schools, defined as educational institutions that specialize in teaching courses and programs related to business and/or management, are facing major challenges. These challenges stem from a number of major shifts in the business education landscape, including the rising importance of rankings and accreditations, the increased weight placed on ethical decision making, the ongoing debate on rigor vs. relevance in research, the digital revolution, and the significant decrease in public funding. In fact, they are so fundamental that the coming decade is likely to represent a new era in the history of business education, the fourth since the concept of the business school was created in 1819 with the establishment of ESCP Europe. The purpose of this article is to outline these main changes (TASK: Tâ€”from tower to Twittersphere, Aâ€”from auditorium to anti-cafÃ©, Sâ€”from stakeholder to shareholder, Kâ€”from knowledge to know-how) and to discuss how they impact the different AS-SE-TS of a business school (alumni & students, staff & equipment, teachers & scholars). The article ends with a proposed classification of schools along four corners (culture, compass, capital, and content) and a discussion of which types of schools are best suited to adapt to these changes."
,,,"This study highlights the potential impacts of blockchain technology on the collaborative economy (CE), colloquially known as the sharing economy. This conceptual review first analyzes how the CE intersects with the blockchain technology. Collaborative consumption involves an intensification of peer-to-peer trade, underpinned by robust digital infrastructures and processes, hence an increased use of new technologies and a redefinition of business activities. As an inherently connected economy, the CE is, therefore, prone to integrating the most recent technological advances including artificial intelligence, big data analysis, augmented reality, the smart grid, and blockchain technology. This review then furthers the examination of the organizational and managerial implications related to the use of blockchain technology in terms of governance, transaction costs, and user confidence. A closing case finally examines the role of a prominent social networking site (i.e., Facebook) in the CE-blockchain nexus."
,,,"Algorithmic trading is a continuous perception and decision making problem, where environment perception requires to learn feature representation from highly nonstationary and noisy financial time series, and decision making requires the algorithm to explore the environment and simultaneously make correct decisions in an online manner without any supervised information. To address these two problems, we propose a time-driven feature-aware jointly deep reinforcement learning model (TFJ-DRL) that integrates deep learning model and reinforcement learning model to improve the financial signal representation learning and action decision making in algorithmic trading. Concretely, we learn the environmental representation by adaptively selecting and reweighting various features of financial signals and summarize the attention values between historical information and changing trend depending on the current state. Besides, the supervised deep learning and reinforcement learning are jointly and iteratively trained to make full use of the supervised signals in the training data, and obtain more update information and stricter loss function constraints, thereby increasing investment returns. TFJ-DRL is evaluated on real-world financial data with different price trends (rising, falling and no obvious direction). A series of analysis show the robust superiority and the extensive applicability of the proposed method."
,,,"Social innovation (SI) offers a sustainable solution to prevalent social issues/problems and is typically developed and deployed by a varied set of people from the society adopting a top-down and/or bottom-up approach. The disruption of new-age technologies (NATs) is immensely impacting the space of SIs, providing a resource-efficient solution, and bringing multiple outcome benefits. In this study, we discuss the SIs driven by new-age technologies and attempt to address a few critical questions around such SIs to better understand the construct, such as â€“ What is SI? How are NATs playing a role in providing an innovative offering for the social good? Where does it take place in society? How can SI be deployed in society to reach out to the populace? and, Why SI is required for society? By employing the triangulation approach, we provide a comprehensive framework recognizing the different contexts under which SI takes place in society, explaining the possible outcomes and suggesting the boundary conditions. We then provide the generalized propositions on the proposed relationship in the SI framework. Further, this study identifies directions for future research and provides implications for firms, policymakers, and social entrepreneurs."
,,,"The fourth industrial revolution, also labelled Industry 4.0, was beget with emergent and disruptive intelligence and information technologies. These new technologies are enabling ever-higher levels of production efficiencies. They also have the potential to dramatically influence social and environmental sustainable development. Organizations need to consider Industry 4.0 technologies contribution to sustainability. Sufficient guidance, in this respect, is lacking in the scholarly or practitioner literature. In this study, we further examine Industry 4.0 technologies in terms of application and sustainability implications. We introduce a measures framework for sustainability based on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals; incorporating various economic, environmental and social attributes. We also develop a hybrid multi-situation decision method integrating hesitant fuzzy set, cumulative prospect theory and VIKOR. This method can effectively evaluate Industry 4.0 technologies based on their sustainable performance and application. We apply the method using secondary case information from a report of the World Economic Forum. The results show that mobile technology has the greatest impact on sustainability in all industries, and nanotechnology, mobile technology, simulation and drones have the highest impact on sustainability in the automotive, electronics, food and beverage, and textile, apparel and footwear industries, respectively. Our recommendation is to take advantage of Industry 4.0 technology adoption to improve sustainability impact but each technology needs to be carefully evaluated as specific technology will variably influence industry and sustainability dimensions. Investment in such technologies should consider appropriate priority investment and championing."
,,,"This paper conceptualizes digital procurement readiness as a dyadic construct and introduces the supply chain practice view (SCPV) as a theoretical lens that can help guide future research on digital procurement. We build on a literature review and on dyadic, explanatory case studies to provide a nuanced understanding of how the digital readiness of supply chain partnersâ€”on both sides of the dyadâ€”needs to co-evolve for the implementation of digital procurement practices. Specifically, we outline how the SCPV can serve as both a holistic and a supply chain-specific framework for future research on the following: 1) the antecedents that help explain why supply chain partners adopt inter-organizational digital procurement practices, and 2) the relational performance outcomes derived from their use. For managers, this study implies the need to explicitly consider interactions with and influences of supply chain partners in their quest to rapidly and effectively digitalize procurement."
,,,"Through a conceptual note and round table discussion, this article builds upon Buckley and Prashantham's (2016) â€œdivision of entrepreneurial labourâ€ notion to consider more closely the perspective of multinational corporations (MNCs) in relation to partnering with startups. First, the capability dimension suggests that there is potential for value creation resulting from complementarity between the strengths of corporations and startups. Second, the connectivity dimension is concerned with how this potential is realised; the rise of corporationsâ€™ programmatic initiatives and third-party specialists are highlighted. Third, the contextuality dimension highlights spatial differences, noting MNCsâ€™ unique opportunities and challenges vis-Ã -vis startup partnering in emerging markets."
,,,"In this chapter, the authors examine the Bitcoin protocol and its innovation. Their conclusion is that Bitcoin's role as a system providing financial services may have been grossly underestimated, and bitcoin's role as an alternative to fiat currencies is likely to fail. This chapter discusses the Bitcoin key engineering elements that offer the possibility of a radically different approach for architecting electronic payment systems among other more sophisticated system such as crowd sales, crowd funding, peer-to-peer exchanges, and other side-chain capabilities. The technologies embedded within the Bitcoin system that have the potential to develop into very open, contestable, and interconnected ecosystems for the delivery of new and existing form of financial services will also be described."
,,,"Research conducted in the innovation field lags behind organizationsâ€™ general technological development and innovativeness. Literature that previously depicted innovation types in developed markets is markedly different from progressively publicized emerging market innovation types. While capital-abundant firms tend to engage in respective pioneering and incremental innovation loops, resource-constrained firms and firms in emerging countries may partially free-ride on existing products and services through innovations such as copycat and frugal. To date, there have been no attempts to holistically consolidate product and service innovation types into one overarching typology. Using novel methods of text mining and co-citation analysis, this study systematically maps three decades of product and service innovation scholarship to provide a typology of eight major product and service innovation types. This is further supported by case study analysis to demonstrate how these innovation types fit into the cost vs market novelty matrix. This study is unique in its methodological proposition to systematically review the innovation scholarship of more than 1,400 articles through comprehensive, quantified, and objective methods that offer transparent and reproducible results. The study provides some clarity regarding the classifications and characteristics of the innovation typology."
,,,"Cryptocurrency has experienced the skyrocketing and falling back in 2018. Beyond the hype, the specific price movements of different cryptocurrencies should be investigated in a more careful way. Since the cryptocurrency market is a non-linear complex system which are not suitable analyzed by tradition methods, this paper introduces methods from econophysics. Mono-fractal analysis (detrended fluctuation analysis, DFA) is applied to investigate the price movement. Further, multi-fractal fluctuation detrended analysis (MF-DFA) is used for robustness test. Through analyzing four representative cryptocurrencies, our paper finds a strong momentum effect in BTC and ETH market, and a reversion effect in XRP and EOS when large fluctuation occurs. These findings may provide a reference for trading strategy in alternative asset allocations."
,,,"This study reviews the presence of articles related to Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) in Web of Science (WOS). Bibliometric analysis first reveals the trends of CEE-related articles in the areas of international business (IB), management and economics up to 2016. The results show steady growth in absolute and relative numbers after 1990, intensifying since 2010. Second, we conduct topic research using network analysis with blockmodeling. We identify a network of topics and their interrelations over time and used them to periodise the CEE-related research in IB. The most-cited CEE-related IB articles and the main citation path are also presented. The analysis adds to the discussion of how the CEE region is explored in IB research, its contributions, impacts and the challenges facing regional research in the future. In this study, a methodology and framework for performing a comprehensive bibliometric analysis on regional IB research is applied."
,,,"The aim of the article is to verify whether bitcoin can act as a hedge, diversifier or safe haven on various stock markets, depending on the economic situation in the countries. To diversify the sample, we include five very different countries in our study: Japan, Venezuela, China, Estonia, and Sweden. Using daily data over the period 2014â€“2017, we estimate the dynamic conditional correlation model between main stock indices and bitcoin price in local currencies (Bitflyer â€”Â in the case of the yen, Kraken â€”Â in the case of the euro, Huobi in the case of yuan and LocalBitcoins in all the remaining cases), as well as between main stock indices and the bitcoin price in the US dollar (Bitfinex exchange). We apply the Stochastic Volatility Model with the Dynamic Conditional Correlation. We add binary variables into the dynamic correlation equation, indicating the occurrence of extreme return on the stock-exchange index in the lower 1%, 5% and 10% quantile. The conclusions vary, depending whether we consider trade on the local bitcoin exchanges or in the global one. We conclude that bitcoin was treated as a safe haven asset only in the case of Venezuela and investments in bolivars. In the case of local investments in Japan and China bitcoin behaved as a diversifier. In the bitcoin-friendly economies of Sweden and Estonia it acted as a weak hedge. In the case of the USD trade, the results suggest that bitcoin is a weak hedge with respect to all of the analyzed markets."
,,,"The financial system, which governs and manages the practice of deposits, lending and payments, is in the throes of disruption following the shortcomings of the current regime. Despite US$11 trillion in quantitative easing since 2007, economic growth has been persistently sluggish. The money isn't going where it should be. In 2015, McKinsey reported that global debt had grown by US$57 trillion since 2007. The debt is becoming unsustainable, yet the global debt-to-income ratio continues to rise disproportionally to any deleveraging. The Fed's meandering signaling to nudge up interest rates beyond the near zero range raises concerns that private and even public debt could become unserviceable, reeling the economy back into a serious recession."
,,,"Testing the planning of resource utilisation across food supply chains provides sustainability and security reporting that can resonate with consumer requirements. The research reported here demonstrates this approach for fast throughput convenience foods that have short shelf life and whose product development must be agile enough to meet changing consumer demand. The higher-level outputs of these conditions are the responsible reporting of nutritional, greenhouse gas emission and packaging impact assessments. Together with the food safety requirements of this food category, it means that manufacturing operations are in some of the most challenging arenas for sustainability assessment. The analysis presented here shows that food production systems can no longer focus on one or two core conditions, such as food safety or quality. This is a strategy of least resistance that has previously worked but it continues to displace risks elsewhere within the food and beverage meta-system, rather than attempting to reconcile complexities and address intra-system root causes. By taking a holistic view the food ecosystem approach can inter-connect requirements using digital and externally linked platforms that will fundamentally change the way future food systems operate. The integration and streaming of these platforms are only achieved through innovation, with the end-user providing development and balance in emergent business ecosystems."
,,,"This paper studies simple moving average trading strategies employing daily price data on the eleven most-traded cryptocurrencies in the 2016â€“2018 period. Our results indicate a variable moving average strategy is successful when using the 20 days moving average trading strategy. Specifically, excluding Bitcoin the technical trading rule generates an excess return of 8.76% p.a. after controlling for the average market return. Our results suggest that cryptocurrency markets are inefficient."
,,,"In this study, we compare the safe-haven properties of Bitcoin, gold, and the commodity index against world, developed, emerging, USA, and Chinese stock market indices for the period 20 July 2010â€“22 February 2018. We apply the wavelet coherency approach and show that the overall dependence between Bitcoin/gold/commodities and the stock markets is not very strong at various time scales, with Bitcoin being the least dependent. We study the diversification potential at the tail of the return distribution through wavelet value-at-risk (VaR) and reveal that the degree of co-movement between gold and stock returns affects the portfolioâ€™s VaR level. Specifically, the benefits of diversification vary in the time-frequency space, with Bitcoin exhibiting a superiority over both gold and commodities. Our findings are useful for investors and financial advisors searching for the best asset among Bitcoin, gold, and commodities to hedge extreme negative movements in stock market indices, while accounting for the heterogeneity in the horizons of investors."
,,,"The Internet is now a common medium for consumers and an indispensable business tool globally. Despite this reality, research involving the Internet in international management has been limited. This is surprising in that, the Internet, as an external environmental force, is consequential in terms of its restrictions, privacy concerns, and preferred patterns of use which, as with other environmental imperatives, should supersede the smooth functioning of managerial functions. With this in mind, we examine the development of the literature in international management/businesses incorporating the Internet and unfold its intellectual structure in an effort to motivate future investigations. Specifically, we develop an interpretable spatial configuration of knowledge nodes in the strategy, general management, entrepreneurship, and international business literature. However, the literature for human resources and organizational behavior did not result in an interpretable MDS configuration. As a precursor to the three contributions to this special issue, we offer future research opportunities based on our analysis of the knowledge structure in the field as well as via a framework involving Internet regulations and firm structure."
,,,"Recent advances in science mapping allowed to analyze the entire intellectual structure of blockchain and cryptocurrencies in business-related disciplines to identify 174 academic articles as well as 1482 practitioner-oriented articles published since the inception of cryptocurrencies in 2008 to highlight key trends of the published outputs. The results demonstrate academic research done by 389 authors in 296 organizations based in 50 countries that only just initiated the conversation on four major streams of the literatureâ€”Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies; blockchain adoption; cryptocurrency and blockchain environment; and business model innovations. When comparing academic scholarship to practitioner-oriented literature, the results demonstrate that practitioners discussed investor-related themes, cryptocurrency intrinsic value, political-economic sphere, and the impact of cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies on the wider society in greater detail. As a result, a number of themes are identified and discussed that could align academic and practitioner interests and provide guidance for further research in this important field."
,,,"Agriculture plays an important role in sustaining all human activities. Major challenges such as overpopulation, competition for resources poses a threat to the food security of the planet. In order to tackle the ever-increasing complex problems in agricultural production systems, advancements in smart farming and precision agriculture offers important tools to address agricultural sustainability challenges. Data analytics hold the key to ensure future food security, food safety, and ecological sustainability. Disruptive information and communication technologies such as machine learning, big data analytics, cloud computing, and blockchain can address several problems such as productivity and yield improvement, water conservation, ensuring soil and plant health, and enhance environmental stewardship. The current study presents a systematic review of machine learning (ML) applications in agricultural supply chains (ASCs). Ninety three research papers were reviewed based on the applications of different ML algorithms in different phases of the ASCs. The study highlights how ASCs can benefit from ML techniques and lead to ASC sustainability. Based on the study findings an ML applications framework for sustainable ASC is proposed. The framework identifies the role of ML algorithms in providing real-time analytic insights for pro-active data-driven decision-making in the ASCs and provides the researchers, practitioners, and policymakers with guidelines on the successful management of ASCs for improved agricultural productivity and sustainability."
,,,"Port Community Systems (PCS) are inter-organizational software platforms that connects port community actors, enabling commercial services and information exchange between the port to their customers and a variety of stakeholders. Our main motivation for this paper lies in the absence of surveys on the PCS literature, hence the purpose of this paper is to perform a structured literature review on PCS to establish promising research gaps. Such review was conducted surveying the literature about PCS from 2001 until 2019. The study introduces a detailed and current worldwide PCS inventory using a proposed evolution framework and a taxonomy, the latter built upon commonly cited factors from the IT systems development literature in the context of port communities, which are synthesized into three frames: a Business frame, an Integration frame, and a Legal frame. Findings show that literature on PCS is scarce and fragmented, oftentimes with PCS research published in non-specialized documents on the topic, with few comparative studies between countries and several countries receiving little attention. Few authors have high specialization on the topic while most authors in average contribute less than once to the body of knowledge. Additionally, it was found that industry is ahead of scientific research in terms of documenting PCS development and technical features. The results also show a lack of innovation regarding PCS research studies, which risks relegating PCS research to irrelevance. A major critique to extant PCS literature is about its inertia, as research tends to be excessively comfortable with the legacy PCS, neglecting its need to evolve and adapt to new markets (in response to the growth of emerging economies) or to extended functionalities (taking advantage of the surge of new technologies). Furthermore, it was found that the future of PCS research should aim for addressing practical needs, while fostering collaboration among practitioners and scholars."
,,,"This paper joins discussions about Bitcoin's relationship to investments in developed and emerging markets. Our study contributes to the ongoing discussion of the role of Bitcoin for investors. In our research, we analyse relationships on financial markets with Bitcoin user graph characteristics. We examine the relationships between Bitcoin rates of return, stock indices, and variables characterising Bitcoin users who carried out the largest number of Bitcoin buy and sell transactions and users who carried out transactions with the highest amounts. We mainly focus on the problem whether the Bitcoin rate of return is mostly driven by capital market situation or major Bitcoin users behaviour. Our results confirmed that there is not, in general, significant relationship between financial market situation (if such relationship does exist, it is found in emerging markets). However, our findings indicate a significant impact of the behaviour of major Bitcoin users on Bitcoin rate of return."
,,,"We apply different techniques and uncover the quantile conditional dependence between the global financial stress index and Bitcoin returns from July 18, 2010, to December 29, 2017. The results from the copula-based dependence show evidence of right-tail dependence between the global financial stress index and Bitcoin returns. We focus on the conditional quantile dependence and indicate that the global financial stress index strongly Granger-causes Bitcoin returns at the left and right tail of the distribution of the Bitcoin returns, conditional on the global financial stress index. Finally, we use a bivariate cross-quantilogram approach and show only limited directional predictability from the global financial stress index to Bitcoin returns in the medium term, for which Bitcoin can act as a safe-haven against global financial stress."
,,,"Based on daily data about Bitcoin and six other major financial assets (stocks, commodity futures (commodities), gold, foreign exchange (FX), monetary assets, and bonds) in China from 2013 to 2017, we use a VAR-GARCH-BEKK model to investigate mean and volatility spillover effects between Bitcoin and other major assets and explore whether Bitcoin can be used either as a hedging asset or a safe haven. Our empirical results show that (i) only the monetary market, i.e., the Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (SHIIBOR) has a mean spillover effect on Bitcoin and (ii) gold, monetary, and bond markets have volatility spillover effects on Bitcoin, while Bitcoin has a volatility spillover effect only on the gold market. We further find that Bitcoin can be hedged against stocks, bonds and SHIBOR and is a safe haven when extreme price changes occur in the monetary market. Our findings provide useful information for investors and portfolio risk managers who have invested or hedged with Bitcoin."
,,,"This paper investigates the adaptive market hypothesis (AMH) with respect to the high frequency markets of the two largest cryptocurrencies â€” Bitcoin and Ethereum, versus the Euro and US Dollar. Our findings are consistent with the AMH and show that the efficiency of the markets varies over time. We also discuss possible news and events which coincide with significant changes in the market efficiency. Furthermore, we analyse the effect of the sentiment of these news and other factors (events) on the market efficiency in the high frequency setting, and provide a simple event analysis to investigate whether specific factors affect the market efficiency/inefficiency. The results show that the sentiment and types of news and events may not be significant factor in determining the efficiency of cryptocurrency markets."
,,,"Following the new advances in encryption and network computing, Bitcoin emerged as a private sector system facilitating peer-to-peer exchange via distributed ledgers based on blockchains, driving a transformational change towards a global economy outside the core financial system. The main purpose of this paper is to examine the multifractal properties of the Bitcoin price using high frequency data. The methods used are the wavelet transform modulus maxima and the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis. The results indicate that Bitcoin exhibits a large degree of multifractality in all examined time intervals, and the main source of multifractality is attributed to the high kurtosis and the fat distributional tails of the series returns."
,,,"Digital technologies are transforming the delivery of financial services everywhere. Among its many benefits, â€œfintechâ€ offers new opportunities to widen access to financial services. The potential for improving people's lives through financial inclusion is enormous, and many of the gains are already being realized. There are risks as well, though, and making the most of these opportunities will require skillful regulation. At the moment, regulators and policymakers alike are struggling to keep up."
,,,"In terms of development cycle, renewable energy (RE) projects entail funding supports from the technological innovation stage onwards. Due to uncertainties in resource availability and technical risk, only a limited variety of funding sources are available for startups. As the RE development project passes through this early stage into technical maturity, more funding sources may be attracted to bring it to commercial fruition. When the technology is eventually deployable to mass applications, even more funding venues exist, sometimes enabling exit of the original innovators via transfer of ownership, or fostering asset growth with investor participation in built facilities. Due to the environmental benefits to be harvested, governments have a pivotal role to play in relation to funding, either directly or indirectly at all stages. This research is aimed at identifying the developmental stages of RE projects and studying the inter-relationships with stakeholders, under the influence of technology push and market pull. Discussions are focused on different types of RE projects and modes of financing, culminating in a diagrammatic model depicting the various decision factors to assist funding-raising activities at different RE developmental stages. Illustrations are provided through a series of carefully selected case studies in western countries. This is followed by a discussion on RE development financing in the Asian context, with conclusions drawn in the light of recent emergence of new business models and a smart era. Decision makers in RE projects may regard this article as a guide for their fund raising activities."
,,,"This article examines the co-movement relationship among representative cryptocurrencies from the perspectives of returns and volatility. Wavelet coherence and the correlation network are introduced to explore the interdependence of cryptocurrencies, and then risk reduction and downside risk reduction are used to test the hedging effects of Bitcoin on others at different time frequencies. The empirical results provide evidence of co-movement and hedging effects. Additionally, positive correlations between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies exist on short-to-medium investment horizons. Moreover, both Bitcoin's returns and its volatility are ahead of other cryptocurrencies at low frequencies. In addition, a hedging effect across Bitcoin against other cryptocurrencies is more obvious in the long run. Furthermore, Bitcoin has hedging effects on other cryptocurrencies according to time-frequency horizons."
,,,"The global transition to a low-carbon economy will involve changes in material markets and supply chains on a hitherto unknown scale and scope. With these changes come numerous challenges and opportunities related to supply chain security and sustainability. To help support decision-making as well as future research, this study employs a problem-oriented perspective while reviewing academic publications, technical reports, legal documents, and published industry data to highlight the increasingly interconnected nature of material needs and geopolitical change. The paper considers a broad set of issues including technologies, material supplies, investment strategies, communal concerns, innovations, modeling considerations, and policy trends to help contextualize policy decisions and regulatory responses. Policy options are outlined for each topical section, as well as areas for further research. Together, these recommendations serve to help guide the complex, interdisciplinary approach to materials required for a low-carbon transition."
,,,"The significance of uncertainty in policies related to economic decisions is higher than ever before in todayâ€™s interconnected world. This study contributes to existing research by reviewing the literature on the impact of economic policy uncertainty on corporations and economies worldwide. We show the importance of measuring and tracking uncertainty by highlighting its influence on financial decisions. We examine the growing number of studies that use the economic policy uncertainty index (EPU) of Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016) as a key factor in measuring uncertainty. We then review the impact of EPU on financial markets, macro and micro level, stock markets, corporate behavior, and risk management. Then, we document the asymmetric policy responses of economic uncertainty. Overall, policy uncertainty has a significant impact on firm financial policies as well as on consumer spending. Specifically, corporations act more conservatively during times of high uncertainty, thereby slowing investments in production and employment. In addition to the local effect of EPU, it spills over to other countries."
,,,"International firmsâ€™ activities and structures have become highly complex as a result of managing a vast network of entities located around the world. Complex technology such as Additive Manufacturing or generally accepted as 3D printing has received universal interest. Economic growth in Vietnam generates unique infrastructure, logistics services and transportation challenges and opportunities. Logistics are a critically important priority in international trade, foremost in ongoing regional economic expansion. The main objective of this paper is to examine the impact and benefits of advanced technology, affecting logistics services and transportation in Vietnam. This research applied a descriptive survey methodology to gather primary empirical data on the awareness and the willingness to adapt to the technology of organizations focusing on opportunities for the Vietnam market. The results indicated that organizations have a positive attitude towards 3DP impact. The stronger influence was discovered on customization, new customer value proposition, the competitive advantage, and transportation and storage cost reduction. Vietnam is currently one of the most attractive emerging markets in the world. The findings from this research provide timely and valuable new insights into this phenomenon, as a potential mechanism for assisting the revolution of the transportation industry towards improving traffic congestion and pollution."
,,,"We propose a closed-loop supply chain system that incorporates a trade-in program and refurbishment service simultaneously. Through the trade-in program, retailers collect used old-generation products from customers and provide them with new-generation products at a discount price. It helps to acquire the additional products required for the refurbishment service. The proposed integrated system could be useful to retailers selling the smartphone which has a high potential in emerging markets. We approximate the multistage stochastic optimization model to the robust counterpart which features a second-order cone program. Computational results provide managerial insights that could be beneficial to the retailer."
,,,"The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) is a success story of a Chinese firm growing domestically and then strategically expanding abroad. In 2018, ICBC was the largest bank (by assets) in the world, and operated more than 16,800 Chinese domestic institutions and 400 institutions overseas. Founded in 1984, the bank is headquartered in Beijing and offers corporate banking, personal banking, and treasury operations. By examining its growth and corporate strategy, the chapter provides insights on the ways Chinese banks have leveraged domestic competitive advantages and explored international expansion."
,,,"This paper explores the usage of Blockchain Technology for Land Records Management in India. It highlights issues, such as minimal transparency, accountability, incoherent data sets with different Government Departments pertaining to the same piece of land and delays in the current Land Records management process and how to overcome these problems using Blockchain Technology. The paper describes the current process of land records maintenance and land registration in the country, and discusses various challenges encountered during the implementation of Blockchain Technology like public key infrastructure and Internet, privacy rules and security issues. Finally, the paper illustrates a system design using Blockchain Technology for the implementation of Land Titling system in the country, so that land titles are tamper-proof, and provides authentic and conclusive rights on ownership."
,,,This paper is the result of a crowdsourced effort to surface perspectives on the present and future direction of international finance. The authors are researchers in financial economics who attended the INFINITI 2017 conference in the University of Valencia in June 2017 and who participated in the crowdsourcing via the Overleaf platform. This paper highlights the actual state of scientific knowledge in a multitude of fields in finance and proposes different directions for future research.
,,,"While the potential benefits of integrating digital technologies and supply chain management have been widely reported, less is known concerning the current state-of-the-art literature on big data-driven sustainable supply chains. Therefore, this study aims to systematise published studies which address the implications of big data for sustainable supply chain management. Through a systematic literature review, this work makes three significant contributions: (a) it provides an overview of extant literature on this topic in recent years; (b) it proposes seven gaps in the literature in order to foster future investigations on big data-driven sustainable supply chains; (c) it offers four lessons for business practitioners aiming to use big data for sustainable supply chain practices. These lessons suggest that: developing big data analytics capability has to become a business priority in order to effectively build competitive sustainable supply chains; big data has benefits for each of the dimensions of the triple-bottom-line in supply chains; the implementation of big data for sustainability in supply chains presents some challenges for firms; the development of complementary organizational capabilities is needed to overcome challenges and facilitate the benefits of big data technology for sustainable supply chain management."
,,,"This paper analyzes the evolution of Bitcoin liquidity and its determinants. Using a new methodology to identify the most liquid exchange at each point in time, I find that driving factors behind the overall increases in liquidity and trading activity come mostly from within the Bitcoin network. While the state of the US economy only weakly influences Bitcoin liquidity, there is some evidence that gold and Bitcoin are perceived as complements. Moreover, patterns in market making and trading are consistent with the activity of both institutional and retail traders."
,,,"We investigate the relationship between Bitcoin and conventional financial assets from a perspective on the connectedness of asset networks. We adopt the method of measuring connectedness proposed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2009, 2012, and 2014) in a VAR system to study the dynamic interdependence between returns in Bitcoin, stocks, oil, and gold. We find that the connectedness between bitcoin and conventional assets is weak. The separation of positive and negative returns in the Bitcoin market shows the existence of an asymmetric pattern of the spillover effects between Bitcoin and conventional assets. A rolling window analysis finds that although Bitcoin prices experience a rising link to other financial assets, the magnitude is proven to be moderate. However, connectedness via negative returns is much stronger than via positive ones and exhibits a clearly increasing trend in recent periods. Our results in application are generally robust to other popular cryptocurrencies, such as ETH and Ripple. The findings presented in this paper have important implications for financial market participants, policymakers, and researchers in light of projected increases in the adoption of Bitcoin, as well as the rapid development of cryptocurrency."
,,,"This paper explores the evolving renewable energy â€˜prosumerâ€™ phenomenon in the United Kingdom (UK). It identifies and evaluates how prosumer business models can exist beyond direct subsidy and the range of prosumer business model archetypes currently in operation. Through a series of in-depth interviews and document analysis, the paper identifies the key opportunities and challenges for these innovative energy business models. The analysis shows that recent developments in technology such as the diffusion of smart meters, li-ion batteries, peer-to-peer trading platforms and electric vehicles are opening up a range of new value propositions, which in turn are beginning to be exploited by a range of new business models. In many cases the regulatory, financing and institutional governance landscape of the UK lags behind, however, inhibiting these emerging business models. Moreover, these business models rely on managing a complex set of values for consumers that reach deeper into their lives than traditional tariffs. Thus, successful business models must manage this complexity if they are to be adopted by the disengaged majority. Energy policy and energy practitioners can leverage these emerging trends in service of a low carbon energy transition by adopting â€˜ten principlesâ€™ of prosumerism; and six UK policy recommendations."
,,,"The corona virus (COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2) outbreak has created serious disruptions to many business operations. Among them, many service operations, which require customers to travel and visit a place indoor, become almost infeasible to run in a crowded city like Hong Kong. Motivated by a recent reported real case on an innovative service operation in Hong Kong, we build analytical models to explore how logistics and technologies together can transform the â€œstatic service operationsâ€ to become the â€œbring-service-near-your-homeâ€ mobile service operations. We also highlight how the government may provide the subsidy to support the above mentioned mobile service operation (MSO) to make it financially viable. We specifically show that the government may adopt the fixed-cost-subsidy (FCS) scheme, operations-cost-subsidy (OCS) scheme or safety-technology-support (STS) scheme to help. We further uncover that the OCS scheme would bring a larger consumer surplus than the FCS scheme and is hence more preferable. In the extended models, we first study the case when service fee cannot be changed because of corona virus outbreak (CVO). We then explore the feasibility of adopting MSO in the long run as a financially self-sustainable service operation and derive the analytical conditions under which MSO is a win-win business model for both the service provider and consumers. Finally, we study the optimal safety technology investment problem."
,,,"We present the results of our tenth annual horizon scan. We identified 15 emerging priority topics that may have major positive or negative effects on the future conservation of global biodiversity, but currently have low awareness within the conservation community. We hope to increase research and policy attention on these areas, improving the capacity of the community to mitigate impacts of potentially negative issues, and maximise the benefits of issues that provide opportunities. Topics include advances in crop breeding, which may affect insects and land use; manipulations of natural water flows and weather systems on the Tibetan Plateau; release of carbon and mercury from melting polar ice and thawing permafrost; new funding schemes and regulations; and land-use changes across Indo-Malaysia."
,,,"Beyond the financial domain, the application of blockchain is highly relevant in supply chain traceability, but the trade-offs between implementation challenges and achievable impact remain unclear. In this study, six cases of blockchain-based technologies in the food supply chain were analyzed applying a technology assessment framework that distinguishes between four different components of a technology: technique, knowledge, organization, and product. The study intends to provide new critical insights on how blockchain-based technologies can be implemented in the food supply chain and to further the discussion of social and environmental implications of blockchain-based technologies. The results highlight how blockchain is not a stand-alone-technology, but rather one element in a system of technologies. While blockchain-based technologies are expected to bring a variety of impacts, only some are directly attributable to the blockchain element: increased transparency, traceability, and trust. Other impacts such as improved data management are a side-effect of digitizing non-digital processes. Further research is needed to confirm whether blockchain-based technologies bring the expected sustainability improvements in food supply chains."
,,,"Climate change has a disproportionate impact on the worldâ€™s poor. Developing countries will require tens of billions of dollars in new funding annually to adapt to climate changes. Financial Technology (FinTech) and Blockchain innovations can play a major role in implementing these adaptation plans. Blockchain innovations can help build trust and transparency in international climate finance and could potentially have major implications in scaling and speeding up north-south, south-south, and peer-to-peer climate finance transfers. This chapter will explore the potential of Blockchain to provide scalable solutions in the areas of: tracking climate finance, results tracking, climate adaptation, financial inclusion, and identity. It will discuss requirements to achieve scale, including building the ecosystem by linking Blockchain developers, and funding sources with people working on problems of poverty. The big problems of our time need bold, collaborative solutions."
,,,"Regulatory technology or â€˜RegTechâ€™ is the use of technology, particularly information technology, in the context of regulatory monitoring, reporting and compliance. RegTech to date has focused on the digitization of manual reporting and compliance processes, for example in the context of know-your-customer requirements. This offers tremendous cost savings to the financial services industry and regulators. However, the potential of RegTech is far greater â€“ it could enable close to real-time monitoring and a proportionate regulatory regime that addresses risk and facilitates more efficient regulatory compliance. We argue that the transformative nature of technology will only be captured by a new approach that sits at the nexus between data, digital identity, and regulation. We seek to expose the inadequacy and lack of ambition of simply digitizing analogue processes in a digital financial world. The development of financial technology (â€˜FinTechâ€™), rapid developments in emerging markets, and the recent pro-active stance of regulators in developing regulatory sandboxes, represent a unique combination of events, which could facilitate the transition from one regulatory model to another."
,,,"Distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) such as Blockchain appear to have disruptive economic potential to traditional finance-sector and non-financial markets as the success of crypto currencies demonstrates. While traditional financial and securities markets are highly regulated, DLT transactions and exchanges have so far widely remained unregulated, which potentially poses major threats to individual investors and, via money laundering, terrorist financing, and tax evasion, to society at large. Governments have been taking different approaches to monitoring and regulating the fledgling DLT provision arena. However, the small jurisdiction of Gibraltar, an affluent self-governed and self-financed British overseas territory with a population of 34,000 at the Southern tip of the Iberian Peninsula has taken a proactive approach. What makes this case stand out is that Gibraltar is not only is the first jurisdiction worldwide to regulate general DLT provision, but it is rather using the regulation as a competitive tool and a means for creating new public value. The study inquires the potential benefits and challenges to this particular approach to DLT provision regulation, and it investigates and presents the various facets of public value generation, which might serve as a poster child for fast and smart regulation in the digital age."
,,,"Research in cryptofinance has continued to consider whether Bitcoin possesses a safe haven property as traditionally defined by its correlation with other assets during times of market stress. However, this neglects other attributes of assets that are important to investors during periods of crisis. Bitcoin is more volatile, less liquid, and costlier to transact (in terms of time and fees) than other assets (including gold - the traditional safe haven) even in normal market conditions. Until the market matures, it is therefore unlikely to be worthwhile considering Bitcoin as a safe haven."
,,,"In recent years a new type of tradable assets appeared, generically known as cryptocurrencies. Among them, the most widespread is Bitcoin. Given its novelty, this paper investigates some statistical properties of the Bitcoin market. This study compares Bitcoin and standard currencies dynamics and focuses on the analysis of returns at different time scales. We test the presence of long memory in return time series from 2011 to 2017, using transaction data from one Bitcoin platform. We compute the Hurst exponent by means of the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis method, using a sliding window in order to measure long range dependence. We detect that Hurst exponents changes significantly during the first years of existence of Bitcoin, tending to stabilize in recent times. Additionally, multiscale analysis shows a similar behavior of the Hurst exponent, implying a self-similar process."
